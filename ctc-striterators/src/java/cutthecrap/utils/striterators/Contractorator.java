/**
 * A Contractorator is the reverse of an Expanderator. A Contractorator takes a
 * source Iterator, and consumes elements from it in batches by passing to the
 * Contractor which returns an object when ready. It is upto the Contractor to
 * handle termination conditions. For example, it might batch consume the
 * objects ten at a time with some summary info, but handle that there may be
 * less than ten elements in the final summary.
 * 
 * A Contractor could also be used to chunk up a number of objects for
 * serialization, perhaps for network transmission. Such a pattern might be used
 * with an Expander on the other side to deserialize into an iterator.
