 * Basic implementation should be used when the #of slots to be allocated is

 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo Do an implementation that requires contiguous slots and just stores the
 *       data in a long. The state of a {@link CompactSlotAllocation} is
 *       proportional to the #of slots, while the proposed implementation would
 *       have a fixed size regardless of the #of slots. Much nicer.
