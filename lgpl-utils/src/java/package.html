<title>LGPL Utility Classes</title>

<p>
This module contains several LGPL utility classes, most of which were derived
from other projects and modified to support specific features.  Where possible,
the changes are propagated back to the original projects and these placeholder
classes are then replaced by an updated dependency on the corresponding project.
The classes are compiled into their own <code>lgpl-utils</code> dependency.
