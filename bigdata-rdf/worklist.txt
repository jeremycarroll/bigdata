1. fast closure.

x. incremental closure of loaded documents w/o re-closing the entire store.

   - run the metrics task for this.

2. truth maintanence.  if ungrounded justification chains then filter during TM.

3. concurrent query against last committed state of store.

4. performance testing: various data loads, lehigh, integrated.

x. large scale tests (1+B triples, 2T+ data).

5. SAIL 1.x features:

	- namespace prefixes
	
	- TM in the sail.

Deferred:

 - lucene integration -or- free text search in bigdata.

 - quad store (at least for the indixes and access paths).
 
   - inference does NOT cross graphs.

 - concurrent data load
 
 - full transaction support
 
 - Sesame 2.x integration.
  
 - scale-out version (recent changes broke some features).
 
   - distributed joins.
