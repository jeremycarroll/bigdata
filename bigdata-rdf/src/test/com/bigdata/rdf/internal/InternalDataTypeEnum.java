/**
 * Map declares the code associated with each data type which can be inlined.
 * Inline values MUST be decodable and MUST have a natural order. Whether or not
 * the datatype capable of being inlined is actually inlined is a configuration
 * option for the lexicon. If a data type is not inlined, then its code will be
 * {@link #TermId}, which indicates that the "inline" value is a term identifier
 * which must be resolved against the ID2TERM index to materialize the value.
 * <p>
 * The {@link InternalValueTypeEnum} as 4 distinctions (URI, Literal, BlankNode,
 * and SID) and is coded in the high 2 bits of a byte while the
 * {@link InternalDataTypeEnum} has 64 possible distinctions, which are coded in
 * the lower 6 bits of the same byte. Only a subset of those 64 possible
 * distinctions for inline data types have been declared. The remaining code
 * values are reserved for future use.
 * <p>
 * Note: Unicode values CAN NOT be inlined because (a) Unicode sort keys are not
 * decodable; and (b) the collation rules for Unicode depend on the lexicon
 * configuration, which specifies parameters such as Locale, Strength, etc.
 * <p>
 * Blanks nodes (their IDs are UUIDs) and datatypes with larger values (UUIDs)
 * or varying length values (xsd:integer, xsd:decimanl) can be inlined. Whether
 * it makes sense to do so is a question which trades off redundancy in the
 * statement indices for faster materialization of the data type values and a
 * smaller lexicon. UUIDs for purposes other than blank nodes can also be
 * inlined, however they will have a different prefix to indicate that they are
 * Literals rather than blank nodes.
 * <p>
 * Note: While multidimensional datatypes (such as points or rectangles) could
 * be inlined (in the sense that their values could be converted to unsigned
 * byte[] keys and the keys could be decoded), they can not be placed into a
 * total order which has meaningful semantics by a single index. For example,
 * geo:point describes a 2-dimensional location and lacks any meaningful
 * locality when inlined into the index. The only reason to inline such data
 * types is to avoid indirection through the lexicon to materialize their
 * values. Efficiently resolving points in a region requires the use of a
 * spatial index.

 *          $
 * 
 * @todo It is possible to inline ASCII values (URIs and Literals) if the
 *       lexicon is so configured. Those would be a varying length type.
 *       Alternatively, we could add a Comparator to the B+Tree so we could
 *       directly compare the (decoded) RDF Values in each statement. However,
 *       either approach would be challenged by long literals and the Comparator
 *       would require a DDL or something tricky like byte code to C code
 *       generation to be compatible with a GPU.
 * 
 * @todo Above some configured size, long literals must be allocated in the
 *       lexicon, the inline value will be a termId, the key in the TERM2ID
 *       index will be an MD5 signature (to avoid problems with very long keys)
 *       and the blob reference will be stored in the ID2TERM tuple value. The
 *       blob itself is a raw record in the journal or index segment.
 * 
 * @todo support xsd:decimal coding in KeyBuilder by discarding the precision
 *       and only retaining the scale information. We need to record both the
 *       signum and the scale, and the scale needs to be adjusted to normalize
 *       for either zero or one digits before the decimal. This is nearly the
 *       same coding as {@link BigInteger} except that scale is not quite the
 *       same as runLength (it is runLength base 10, not base 256) so there
 *       might be fence posts there too.
 * 
 * @see http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/
 * 
 * @todo Add support for extensible inline enumerations. Use one code value to
 *       indicate that this is an inline enumeration. Then another 2-4 bytes to
 *       indicate which enumeration (registered somewhere) and then the code for
 *       the enumerated value. E.g., state codes, product codes, etc.
 * 
 * @todo Consider supporting derived types by using the appropriate type from
 *       this enumeration for the code and then recognizing the specific
 *       datatype from an inlined termId for the datatype URI. That would take
 *       one bit from our 6 for "derived", leaving us with 32 base distinctions.
 *       The statements would wind up clustered by the distinction unless we did
 *       something to prevent that.
 *       <p>
 *       If we also always encode the datatype bits, then we have to reserve one
 *       bit for the (termId | inline) distinction which leaves us with only 4
 *       bits for the inline datatype bits, which is just 16 distinctions. That
 *       is enough for the distinctions that we have right now, but it is close
 *       (we have 14 distinctions right now if you exclude TermId). <code>
 *       [termId|inline] : 1
 *       [datatype] : 5 (32 distinctions).
 *       </code> where one datatype code is "extension". If the DTE code is
 *       "extension", then the next 8 bytes are the termId of the datatype URI,
 *       followed by one byte giving the run length of the code points, and
 *       finally [runLength] bytes encoding the code point for a value in the
 *       value space for that specific datatype URI. <code>
 *       [datatypeTermId] : 8 bytes
 *       [runLength] : 1 byte
 *       [codePoint] : [runLength] bytes.
 *       </code>
 *       <p>
 *       While this is not nearly as compact as a two character state code, it
 *       does allow application extensible inlining of critical value types.
 *       <p>
 *       If those code points are assigned in the desired sort order for the
 *       enumerated type, then we can also optimize range queries in the
 *       application specific data types by first projecting the query onto the
 *       code points for the value space of that datatype.
 *       <p>
 *       Another perspective is that the kind of value spaces which correspond
 *       to enumerations are going to be rapidly cached if they are heavily used
 *       so the only benefit might be range queries inside of the value space
 *       and those could also be enabled by enumeration of the points in the
 *       value space which lie in the desired range.
 *       <p>
 *       Given that, yet another proposal would be to reserve one bit to
 *       indicate that the termId of the data type follows the flags byte:<code>
 *       [termId|inline] : 1
 *       [datatypeId] : 1 (when true, the actual datatype URO is different and is inline) 
 *       [datatypeCode] : 4 (16 distinctions).
 *       </code>
 *       <p>
 *       When the datatypeId bit is set, the next field is the termId of the
 *       datatype URI, which is then followed by the representation of the point
 *       in the value space for that datatype URI using the representation of
 *       the specified datatypeCode. For example, if you have a datatype which
 *       specializes <code>xsd:long</code> to create <code>bd:millis</code>, the
 *       datatypeId would partition the index key space based on the actual
 *       datatypeURI while the datatypeCode would specify the manner in which
 *       that value space was captured within the inline representation. (This
 *       relationship would be available from the derivation of the datatype.)
 *       <p>
 *       This last proposal relies on there being a very limited number of
 *       interesting codings for things, basically correspond to the signed and
 *       unsigned primitive data types, xsd:integer, xsd:decimal, xsd:boolean,
 *       and maybe one or two others (since we are nearly out of bits with only
 *       16 distinctions!). [We could include a pattern for N ASCII or UTF-32
 *       characters and capture state codes that way.]
