     * series) is only querying the named graphs.

     * Note: The correct result for this query should be NO solutions. This is
     * one of the cases covered by the DAWG/TCK graph-02 and graph-04 tests. One
     * of those tests verifies that when the data is from the default graph and
     * the query is against the named graphs then there are no solutions. The
     * other test verifies that the opposite is also true - that when the data
     * are from the named graphs and the query is against the default graph that
     * there are no solutions. This test is currently failing because it
     * contradicts that prediction. The test is probably wrong.
