     * Unit test for computing the join variables for a named subquery based on
     * the analysis of the bindings which MUST be produced by the subquery and
     * those which MUST be bound on entry into the group in which the subquery
     * solution set is included within the main query.
     * <p>
     * The join should be on <code>?x</code> in this example.
     * 
     * FIXME Actually, whether we use a join on <code>?x</code> or whether there
     * are NO join variables depends on the expected cardinality of the named
     * solution set and <code>?x rdfs:label ?o</code>. We should only use
     * <code>?x</code> as a join variable if the expected cardinality of
     * <code>?x rdfs:label ?o</code> is LT the expected cardinality of the named
     * solution set. In fact, for this case it probably won't be.
     * 
     * FIXME Write unit tests where the INCLUDE is embedded into a child group.
     * In that location we know that some things are already bound by the parent
     * group so we can be assured that we will use the available join variables.
     * [This really depends on running the INCLUDE after the non-optional joins
     * in the parent, which is itself just a heuristic. In fact, the entire
     * notion of {@link GraphPatternGroup#getIncomingBindings(Set)} depends on
     * this heuristic!]
