<title>bigdata(R) starter kit</title>

<p>

    The starter kit contains some configuration files and scripts that
    can help you get started running a variety of bigdata
    configurations, including:<dl>
	
    <dt>LDS</dt><dd>Local Data Service.  This configuration provides
    an embedded immortal database with full concurrency control and
    monolithic indices.  This option supports only a single data
    service and NO metadata service (hence monolithic indices).  This
    is useful for testing and for scenarios where you need all indices
    to be local.</dd>
	
    <dt>EF</dt><dd>Embedded Federation.  This configuration provides
    an embedded database with full concurrency control and key-range
    partitioned indices (the scale-out architecture, but running
    embedded in a single JVM). This is useful for testing or for
    running on a single server platform.  You can control the #of data
    services that will be created with a configuration option.</dd>
	
    <dt>JF</dt><dd>Jini Federation.  This configuration provides a
    distributed database with full concurrency control and key-range
    partitioned indices (the scale-out architecture running on one or
    more machines).</dd>
	
    </dl>

</p>

<p>
    
    The following scripts may help you get started.  These scripts
    <em>MUST</em> be edited for your platform.  Also, many of the
    scripts assume that you are running a test application (the
    concurrent data loader for the RDF knowledge base) and rely on
    data not supplied with the starter kit (a synthetic data set
    generated using the LUBM benchmark for RDF databases).  Again, you
    will need to edit for your application needs.

    <dl>
    
    <dt>env.sh</dt><dd>Sets up an environment for a Linux host.  You
    will have to edit this to reflect your own platform.  This sets
    various environment variables and it MUST be executed using
    <em>source env.sh</em> so that those variables will be defined in
    the shell you are running (otherwise they will be local to the
    temporary shell in which the script is executed).</dd>

    <dt>runLDS.sh</dt><dd>Starts a test class running against a Local
    Data Service.  The configuration options are specified in the test
    class and may be overriden using <code>-D</code> parameters on the
    command line.</dd>

    <dt>runEF.sh</dt><dd>Starts a test class running against a Local
    Data Service.  The configuration options are specified in the test
    class and may be overriden using <code>-D</code> parameters on the
    command line.</dd>

    <dt>counters.sh</dt><dd>A utility to run an httpd server exposing
    post-mortem performance analysis counters from the load balanced.
    The data services, the metadata service, and the client all report
    performance counters to the load balancer and also optionally
    expose their counters via an embedded real-time httpd service.
    The load balancer aggregates those data.  Some of the data are
    used by the load balancer for its decision-making, but all of the
    aggregated data is made available via an httpd service embedded
    with the load balancer.  The load balancer also saves snapshots of
    the aggregated performance counters on a periodic basis and when
    it is shutdown.  This utility will allow you to navigate those
    snaphots using a web browser.  This has been designed to make it
    modestly easy to grad interesting data and stuff it into a
    worksheet for further analysis, plotting, etc.</dd>

    </dl>

</p>

<p>

    The JF configuration is significantly different from the various
    embedded configurations.  Once you have Jini installed and running
    on at least one host in your cluster and have verified that your
    hosts enabled for multicast, then each bigdata service is started
    separately.  You can start services on any host in the cluster.

</p>

<p>

    Currently there are some startup dependencies, so make sure that
    you start the <code>TimestampServer</code> first, followed by the
    <code>LoadBalancerServer</code>.  With those running you can then
    start as many <code>DataServer</code>s as you wish.  Also be sure
    to start ONE <code>MetadataServer</code>.  (The bigdata federation
    does not support failover services at this time so there can only
    be one TimestampServer and one MetadataServer.)

<p>

    These scripts should be run from the <code>config</code>
    directory.

</p>

</p>

<p>

    The following scripts may help you start a Jini-based bigdata
    federation.  Note that these scripts rely on the files in the
    config directory (TimestampServer0, LoadBalancerServer0,
    DataServer0, etc).

</p>
<p>

    <strong>WARNING: These scripts delete any old start before
    starting the services!!!</strong>

</p>
<p>

    <dl>

    <dt>start3.sh (RUN FIRST), start1.sh, start2.sh </dt>

    <dd> These scripts were developed to start bigdata services on a
    cluster of three Linux machines.  The scripts assume that there is
    a network file system (/nas) on which the scripts and the config
    files are located.  Each service is configured to store its
    persistent data on <code>/var/bigdata</code>.  The load balancer
    is configured to log the performance counters under
    <code>/var/log/bigdata</code> on the host on which it is
    executing.</dd>

    <dt>startAll.sh</dt><dd>Suitable for starting all services when
    you are running on a single host.</dd>

    <dt>startService.sh</dt><dd>A helper script that starts a single
    service.</dd>

    <dt>runJini.sh</dt><dd>A script designed to start a bigdata client
    executing against a bigdata federation that is already
    running. </dd>

    </dl>

</p>

<p>

    The following files are found in the <code>config</code> directory.
    
    <dl>

    <dt>policy.all</dt><dd>A liberal policy that will allow bigdata
    services to start, connect to Jini services, etc.  This is
    referenced from the various scripts as
    <code>../policy.all</code>. More constrained policies can of
    course be developed.</dd>

    <dt>log4j.properties</dt><dd>A log4j configuration file.  The
    various scripts reference this configuration resource as
    <code>file:/nas/config/policy.all</code>.  You will have to edit
    the URL so that the file can be resolved in your environment.</dd>

    <dt>TimestampServer0</dt><dd>A configuration for a timestamp
    service.</dd>

    <dt>LoadBalancerServer0</dt><dd>A configuration for a load
    balancer service.</dd>

    <dt>DataServer{0,1,2,3,4}</dt><dd>Configurations for a set of data
    services.</dd>

    <dt>MetadataServer0</dt><dd>A configuration for a metadata
    service.</dd>

    <dt>Client</dt><dd>A client configuration for connecting to the
    running bigdata federation.</dd>

    </dl>
