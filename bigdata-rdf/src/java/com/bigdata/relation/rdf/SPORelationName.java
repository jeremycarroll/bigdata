/**
 * This is a implementation that identifies a triple store using the namespace
 * for the triple store.
 * 
 * FIXME How will we identify a TempTripleStore? Note that remote data services
 * can not access a local temporary journal. The temporary store will have to be
 * incorporated into either a transaction (automatically managed life cycle) or
 * an explicitly managed _temporary_ index facility for the federation. I like
 * the idea of using the namespace prefix to identify such indices.
