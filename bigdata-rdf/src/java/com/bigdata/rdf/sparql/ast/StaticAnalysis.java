/**
 * Methods for static analysis of a query. There is one method which looks "up".
 * This corresponds to how we actually evaluation things (left to right in the
 * query plan). There are two methods which look "down". This corresponds to the
 * bottom-up evaluation semantics of SPARQL.
 * <p>
 * When determining the "known" bound variables on entry to a node we have to
 * look "up" the tree until we reach the outer most group. Note that named
 * subqueries DO NOT receive bindings from the places where they are INCLUDEd
 * into the query.
 * 
 * <h3>Analysis of Incoming "Known" Bound Variables (Looking Up)</h3>
 * 
 * Static analysis of the incoming "known" bound variables does NOT reflect
 * bottom up evaluation semantics. If a variable binding would not be observed
 * for bottom up evaluation semantics due to a badly designed left join pattern
 * then the AST MUST be rewritten to lift the badly designed left join into a
 * named subquery where it will enjoy effective bottom up evaluation semantics.
 * 
 * <h3>Analysis of "must" and "maybe" Bound Variables (Looking Down).</h3>
 * 
 * The following classes are producers of bindings and need to be handled by
 * static analysis when looking down the AST tree:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>{@link QueryBase}</dt>
 * <dd>The static analysis of the definitely and maybe bound variables depends
 * on the projection and where clauses.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link SubqueryRoot}</dt>
 * <dd>SPARQL 1.1 subquery. This is just the static analysis of the QueryBase
 * for that subquery.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link NamedSubqueryRoot}</dt>
 * <dd>This is just the static analysis of the QueryBase for that named
 * subquery. Named subqueries are run without any visible bindings EXCEPT those
 * which are exogenous.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link NamedSubqueryInclude}</dt>
 * <dd>The static analysis of the INCLUDE is really the static analysis of the
 * NamedSubqueryRoot which produces that solution set. The incoming known
 * variables are ignored when doing the static analysis of the named subquery
 * root.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link ServiceNode}</dt>
 * <dd>The static analysis of the definitely and maybe bound variables depends
 * on the graph pattern for that service call. This is analyzed like a normal
 * graph pattern. Everything visible in the graph pattern is considered to be
 * projected. As far as I can tell, ServiceNodes are not run "as-bound" and
 * their static analysis is as if they were named subqueries (they have no known
 * bound incoming variables other than those communicated by their
 * BindingsClause).</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link StatementPatternNode}</dt>
 * <dd>All variables are definitely bound UNLESS
 * {@link StatementPatternNode#isOptional()} is <code>true</code>.
 * <p>
 * Note: we sometimes attach a simple optional join to the parent group for
 * efficiency, at which point it becomes an "optional" statement pattern. An
 * optional statement pattern may also have zero or more {@link FilterNode}s
 * associated with it.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link JoinGroupNode}</dt>
 * <dd></dd>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link UnionNode}</dt>
 * <dd>The definitely bound variables is the intersection of the definitely
 * bound variables in the child join groups. The maybe bound variables is the
 * union of the definitely bound variables in the child join groups.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link AssignmentNode}</dt>
 * <dd>BIND(expr AS var) in a group will not bind the variable if there is an
 * error when evaluating the value expression and does not fail the solution.
 * Thus BIND() in a group contributes to "maybe" bound variables.
 * <p>
 * Note: BIND() in a PROJECTION is handled differently as it is non-optional (if
 * the value expression results in an error the solution is dropped).
 * Projections are handled when we do the analysis of a QueryBase node since we
 * can see both the WHERE clause and the PROJECTION clauses at the same time.
 * <p>
 * See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#assignment"> If the
 * evaluation of the expression produces an error, the variable remains unbound
 * for that solution.</a></dd>
 * 
 * <dt><code>IF()</code></dt>
 * <dd>
 * * <code>IF</code> semantics : If evaluating the first argument raises an
 * error, then an error is raised for the evaluation of the IF expression. (This
 * greatly simplifies the analysis of the EBV of the IF value expressions, but
 * there is still uncertainty concerning whether the THEN or the ELSE is
 * executed for a given solution.) However, <code>IF</code> is not allowed to
 * conditionally bind a variable in the THEN/ELSE expressions so we do not have
 * to consider it here.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt><code>BOUND(var)</code></dt>
 * <dd>Filters which use BOUND() can not be pruned unless we can prove that the
 * variable is not (or is not) bound and also collapse the filter to a constant
 * after substituting either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> in for the
 * BOUND() expression.</dd>
 * 
 * </dl>
 * 
 * <h3>FILTERs</h3>
 * 
 * FILTERs are groups based on whether they can run before any required joins
 * (pre-), with the required join (join-), or after all joins (post-).
 * <dl>
 * <dt>pre-</dt>
 * <dd>The pre-filters have all their required variables bound on entry to the
 * join group. They should be lifted into the parent join group.</dd>
 * <dt>join-</dt>
 * <dd>The join-filters will have all their required variables bound by the time
 * the required joins are done. These filters will wind up attached to the
 * appropriate required join. The specific filter/join attachments depend on the
 * join evaluation order.</dd>
 * <dt>post-</dt>
 * <dd>The post-filters might not have all of their required variables bound. We
 * have to wait until the last of the optionals joins has been evaluated before
 * we can evaluate any post-filters, so they run "last".</dd>
 * <dt>prune-</dt>
 * <dd>The prune-filters are those whose required variables CAN NOT be bound.
 * They should be pruned from the AST.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * 
 * TODO We can probably cache the heck out of things on this class. There is no
 * reason to recompute the SA of the know or maybe/must bound variables until
 * there is an AST change, and the caller can build a new SA when that happens.
 * However, note that we must make the cache sets unmodifiable since there are a
 * lot of patterns which rely on computing the difference between two sets and
 * those can not have a side-effect on the cache.
 * <p>
 * We could also attach the {@link StaticAnalysis} as an annotation on the
 * {@link QueryRoot} and provide a factory method for accessing it. That way we
 * would have reuse of the cached static analysis data. Each AST optimizer (or
 * the {@link ASTOptimizerList}) would have to clear the cached
 * {@link StaticAnalysis} when producing a new {@link QueryRoot}. Do this when
 * we add an ASTContainer to provide a better home for the queryStr, the parse
 * tree, the original AST, and the optimized AST.
 * 
 * TODO Static analysis of variables which are projected by a subquery needs to
 * follow the variable into the subquery under what ever name it has within the
 * subquery scope. That is, SELECT (?x as ?y) renames the variable. So, if we
 * are following ?y in the parent scope then we need to follow ?x in the
 * subquery scope.
