 * Integration with the Runtime Optimizer (RTO).

 * TODO The initial integration aims to run only queries that are simple join
 * groups with filters. Once we have this integrated so that it can be enabled
 * with a query hint, then we can look into handling subgroups, materialization,
 * etc. Even handling filters will be somewhat tricky due to the requirement for
 * conditional materialization of variable bindings in advance of certain
 * {@link IValueExpression} depending on the {@link INeedsMaterialization}
 * interface. Therefore, the place to start is with simple join groups and
 * filters whose {@link IValueExpression}s do not require materialization.
 * 
 * TODO We need a way to inspect the RTO behavior. It will get logged, but it
 * would be nice to attach it to the query plan. Likewise, it would be nice to
 * surface this to the caller so the RTO can be used to guide query construction
 * UIs.
