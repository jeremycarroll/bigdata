 *      TODO Add option to indicate that the service supports the ESTCARD
 *      feature ( fast range count for a triple pattern)? The feature should be
 *      disclosed through the service description, but we will need to publish a
 *      unique URI for that feature. Maybe we can get openrdf to implement the
 *      feature as well?
