/**
 * A factory for service calls against remote SPARQL end points. You can control
 * the way in which bigdata handles SPARQL 1.1 Federated Query for a remote
 * SPARQL end point by: (1) create an instance of this class for the SPARQL end
 * point; (2) customize the {@link RemoteServiceOptions}; and (3) add it to this
 * {@link ServiceRegistry}. You can also subclass this class if you want to
 * support configuration options which are not already supported by
 * {@link RemoteServiceOptions} and {@link RemoteServiceCallImpl}.
