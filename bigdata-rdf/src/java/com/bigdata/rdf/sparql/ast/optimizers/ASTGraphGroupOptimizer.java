/**
 * Handles a variety of special constructions related to graph graph groups.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * - GRAPH ?foo means that anything nested (even if a subquery) is
 *   contrained to be from ?foo.  
 * 
 *    - All nested statement patterns must have ?foo as their context,
 *      even if they occur within a subquery. (This is not true for a
 *      named subquery which just projects its solutions but does not
 *      inherit the parent's graph context.)
 *    
 *    - GRAPH ?foo { GRAPH ?bar } }.  The easy way to enforce this
 *      constraint when there are nested graph patterns is with a
 *      SameTerm(?foo,?bar) constraint inside of the nested graph
 *      pattern.
 * 
 *      The problem with this is that it does not enforce the constraint
 *      as soon as possible under some conditions. A rewrite of the
 *      variable would have that effect but the rewrite needs to be aware
 *      of variable scope rules so we do not rewrite the variable within
 *      a subquery if it is not projected by that subquery.  We would
 *      also have to add a BIND(?foo AS ?bar) to make ?bar visible in the
 *      scope of parent groups.  
 * 
 *      However, there is an INCLUDE problem too.  That could be handled
 *      by moving the INCLUDE into a subgroup with a BIND to renamed the
 *      variable or by adding a "projection" to the INCLUDE so we could
 *      rename the variable there.
 * 
 *      Since this construction of nested graph patterns is rare, and
 *      since it is complicated to make it more efficient, we are going
 *      with the SameTerm() constraint for now.
 * 
 *    - If a constant is nested within a non-optional GRAPH <uri> then
 *      that constant could be lifted up and bound using Constant/2 on
 *      the outer graph pattern.  Again, this is an optimization which
 *      may not contribute much value except in very rare cases.  We do
 *      not need to do anything additional to make this case correct.
 * 
 *    - It is an query error if a GRAPH <uri> is nested within another
 *      GRAPH <uri> for distinct IRIs.
 * 
 * - GRAPH uri is only allowed if the uri is in the named data set (or if
 *   no data set was given).  Translation time error.
 * 
 * - An empty {} matches a single empty solution. Since we always push in
 *   an empty solution and the join of anything with an empty solution is
 *   that source solution, this is the same as not running the group, so
 *   we just eliminate the empty group.
 *          
 * - GRAPH ?g {} matches the distinct named graphs in the named graph
 *   portion of the data set (special case). 
 * 
 *   - If ?g might be bound or is not bound:
 * 
 *      - If there is no data set, then this should be translated into
 *        sp(_,_,_,?g)[filter=distinct] that should be recognized and
 *        evaluated using a distinct term advancer on CSPO.
 * 
 *      - If the named graphs are listed explicitly, then just visit that
 *        list [e.g., pump them into an htree].
 * 
 *     Either way, if there is a filter then apply the filter to the
 *     scan/list.
 * 
 *   - If ?g is bound coming into the join group then we want to test for
 *     the existence of at least one statement on the CSPO index for ?g.
 *     This is a CSPO iterator with C bound and a limit of one.
 *          
 * - GRAPH <uri> {} is an existence test for the graph. This is a CSPO
 *   iterator with C bound and a limit of one.  However, lift this into a
 *   named subquery since we only want to run it once (or precompute the
 *   result).
 *
