/**
 * Rewrites aspects of queries where bottom-up evaluation would produce
 * different results. This includes joins which are not "well designed" as
 * defined in section 4.2 of "Semantics and Complexity of SPARQL", 2006, Jorge
 * PÃ©rez et al.
 * <p>
 * Note: The test suite for this class is a set of DAWG tests which focus on
 * bottom up evaluation semantics, including:
 * <p>
 * Nested Optionals - 1 (Query is not well designed because there are no shared
 * variables in the intermediate join group and there is an embedded OPTIONAL
 * join group. Since ?v is not present in the intermediate join group the (:x3
 * :q ?w . OPTIONAL { :x2 :p ?v }) solutions must be computed first and then
 * joined against the (:x1 :p ?v) solutions.)
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SELECT *
 * { 
 *     :x1 :p ?v .
 *     OPTIONAL
 *     {
 *       :x3 :q ?w .
 *       OPTIONAL { :x2 :p ?v }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Filter-scope - 1 (Query is not well designed because there are no shared
 * variables in the intermediate join group and there is an embedded OPTIONAL
 * join group. Also, ?v is used in the FILTER but is not visible in that scope,
 * but that issue is handled by the {@link ASTPruneFiltersOptimizer}.)
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SELECT *
 * { 
 *     :x :p ?v . 
 *     { :x :q ?w 
 *       OPTIONAL {  :x :p ?v2 FILTER(?v = 1) }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Join-scope - 1 (Query is not well designed because there are no shared
 * variables in the intermediate group and there is an embedded OPTIONAL join
 * group.)
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SELECT *
 * { 
 *   ?X  :name "paul"
 *   {?Y :name "george" . OPTIONAL { ?X :email ?Z } }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Nested groups which do not share variables with their parent can be lifted
 * out into a named subquery. This has the same effect as bottom up evaluation
 * since we will run the named subquery first and then perform the join against
 * the parent group. However, in this case an exogenous binding which causes a
 * shared variable to exist would mean that the query could run normally since
 * the value in the outer group and the inner group would now be correlated
 * through the exogenous binding. E.g., <code?X</code> in the last example
 * above.

 *          TODO What about a badly designed left-join inside of a sub-select
 *          (or EXISTS)? If we lift that out in this manner, it will run once in
 *          a relatively under constrained named subquery. I guess that's the
 *          consequence of bottom-up evaluation. You do not have the advantage
 *          of propagation of as-bound values. However, maybe we could analyze
 *          the parent context further to develop constraints which could be
 *          imposed on the lifted group?
