/**
 * Rewrites aspects of queries where bottom-up evaluation would produce
 * different results. This includes joins which are not "well designed" as
 * defined in section 4.2 of "Semantics and Complexity of SPARQL", 2006, Jorge
 * PÃ©rez et al. It also includes the evaluation of filters when they are using
 * variables which are guarantee to not be bound in the context in which the
 * filter is evaluation.
 * <p>
 * Note: The test suite for this class is a set of DAWG tests which focus on
 * bottom up evaluation semantics, including:
 * <p>
 * Nested Optionals - 1 (Query is not well designed because there are no shared
 * variables in the intermediate join group and there is an embedded OPTIONAL
 * join group. Since ?v is not present in the intermediate join group the (:x3
 * :q ?w . OPTIONAL { :x2 :p ?v }) solutions must be computed first and then
 * joined against the (:x1 :p ?v) solutions.)
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SELECT *
 * { 
 *     :x1 :p ?v .
 *     OPTIONAL
 *     {
 *       :x3 :q ?w .
 *       OPTIONAL { :x2 :p ?v }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Filter-nested - 2 (Filter on variable ?v which is not in scope)
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SELECT ?v
 * { :x :p ?v . { FILTER(?v = 1) } }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Filter-scope - 1 (Query is not well designed because there are no shared
 * variables in the intermediate join group and there is an embedded OPTIONAL
 * join group. Also, ?v is used in the FILTER but is not visible in that scope.)
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SELECT *
 * { 
 *     :x :p ?v . 
 *     { :x :q ?w 
 *       OPTIONAL {  :x :p ?v2 FILTER(?v = 1) }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Join-scope - 1 (Query is not well designed because there are no shared
 * variables in the intermediate group and there is an embedded OPTIONAL join
 * group.)
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SELECT *
 * { 
 *   ?X  :name "paul"
 *   {?Y :name "george" . OPTIONAL { ?X :email ?Z } }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * We can handle the problems identified in these tests by a combination of
 * mechanisms:
 * <ul>
 * <li>FILTERs which use variables which can not be bound may be elimated, but
 * only if the variable is not bound in the provided {@link IBindingSet}[].
 * Since we need to consider exogenous bindings, this can not always solve the
 * problem for badly designed queries with a FILTER on an known unbound
 * variable.</li>
 * <li>Nested groups which do not share variables with their parent can be
 * lifted out into a named subquery. This has the same effect as bottom up
 * evaluation since we will run the named subquery first and then perform the
 * join against the parent group. However, in this case an exogenous binding
 * which causes a shared variable to exist would mean that the query could run
 * normally since the value in the outer group and the inner group would now be
 * correlated through the exogenous binding. E.g., <code?X</code> in the last
 * example above.</li>
 * </ul>
