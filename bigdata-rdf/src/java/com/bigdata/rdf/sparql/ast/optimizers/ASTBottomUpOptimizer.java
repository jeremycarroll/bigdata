/**
 * Rewrites aspects of queries where bottom-up evaluation would produce
 * different results. This includes joins which are not "well designed" as
 * defined in section 4.2 of "Semantics and Complexity of SPARQL", 2006, Jorge
 * PÃ©rez et al and also FILTERs on variables whose bindings are not in scope.
 * <p>
 * Note: The test suite for this class is a set of DAWG tests which focus on
 * bottom up evaluation semantics, including:
 * <p>
 * Nested Optionals - 1 (Query is not well designed because there are no shared
 * variables in the intermediate join group and there is an embedded OPTIONAL
 * join group. Since ?v is not present in the intermediate join group the (:x3
 * :q ?w . OPTIONAL { :x2 :p ?v }) solutions must be computed first and then
 * joined against the (:x1 :p ?v) solutions.)
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SELECT *
 * { 
 *     :x1 :p ?v .
 *     OPTIONAL
 *     {
 *       :x3 :q ?w .
 *       OPTIONAL { :x2 :p ?v }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Filter-scope - 1 (Query is not well designed because there are no shared
 * variables in the intermediate join group and there is an embedded OPTIONAL
 * join group. Also, ?v is used in the FILTER but is not visible in that scope.)
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SELECT *
 * { 
 *     :x :p ?v . 
 *     { :x :q ?w 
 *       OPTIONAL {  :x :p ?v2 FILTER(?v = 1) }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Join-scope - 1 (Query is not well designed because there are no shared
 * variables in the intermediate group and there is an embedded OPTIONAL join
 * group.)
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SELECT *
 * { 
 *   ?X  :name "paul"
 *   {?Y :name "george" . OPTIONAL { ?X :email ?Z } }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Filter-nested - 2 (Filter on variable ?v which is not in scope)
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SELECT ?v
 * { :x :p ?v . { FILTER(?v = 1) } }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Nested groups which do not share variables with their parent can be lifted
 * out into a named subquery. This has the same effect as bottom up evaluation
 * since we will run the named subquery first and then perform the join against
 * the parent group. However, in this case an exogenous binding which causes a
 * shared variable to exist would mean that the query could run normally since
 * the value in the outer group and the inner group would now be correlated
 * through the exogenous binding. E.g., <code?X</code> in the last example
 * above.

 *          TODO I have been assuming that the presence of any shared variable
 *          is enough to enforce correlation between the solution sets and cause
 *          the results of bottom up evaluation to be the same as our standard
 *          evaluation model. If this is not true then we could just lift
 *          everything into a named subquery, order the named subqueries by
 *          their dependencies and just let it run.
 * 
 *          TODO What about a badly designed left-join inside of a sub-select
 *          (or EXISTS)? If we lift that out in this manner, it will run once in
 *          a relatively under constrained named subquery. I guess that's the
 *          consequence of bottom-up evaluation. You do not have the advantage
 *          of propagation of as-bound values. However, maybe we could analyze
 *          the parent context further to develop constraints which could be
 *          imposed on the lifted group?

    /**
     * If a FILTER depends on a variable which is not in scope for that filter
     * then that variable will always be unbound in that scope. However, we can
     * not fail the entire filter since it could use <code>BOUND(var)</code>.
     * This takes the approach of rewriting the FILTER to use an anonymous
     * variable for any variable which is provably not bound.
     * <p>
     * Note: The alternative approach is to replace the unbound variable with a
     * type error. However, BOUND(?x) would have to be "replaced" by setting its
     * {@link IValueExpressionNode} to [false]. Also, COALESCE(....) could use
     * an unbound variable and no type error should be thrown. We either have to
     * remove the expression the unbound variable shows up in from the
     * COALESCE() or change it to an anonymous variable. If you want to pursue
     * this approach see {@link SparqlTypeErrorBOp#INSTANCE}.

     * @param maybeBound
     *            The set of variables which are in scope in the group.
     * @param map
     *            A map used to provide consistent variable renaming in the
     *            filters of the group.
     * @param parent
