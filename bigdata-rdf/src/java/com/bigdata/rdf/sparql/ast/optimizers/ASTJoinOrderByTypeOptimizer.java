		         * based on the as-bound solutions flowing into the subquery. If the

		         * might be better to lift such unselective subqueries into named
		         * subqueries in order to obtain a hash index over the entire subquery
		         * solution set when evaluated with an empty source binding set.
		         * 
		         * Note: This logic was originally constructed before we had required
		         * joins other than on a statement pattern. This shaped how the FILTERs
		         * were attached and how the materialization pipeline was generated in
		         * order to have materialized RDF Values on hand for those FILTERs.
		         *

		         * pattern joins, SPARQL 1.1 subquery, named subquery include, subquery
		         * hash joins (when the subquery is optional), service call joins, etc.
		         * 
		         * FIXME The code currently only handles the FILTER attachment and
		         * materialization pipeline for the required statement pattern joins.
		         * However, for efficiency, FILTERs MUST be attached to these joins as
		         * appropriate for ALL CASES and variables MUST be materialized as
		         * required for those filters to run.

		         * of cardinality (which has not been extended to handle this yet) or by
		         * the RTO. The filter attachment decisions (and the materialization
