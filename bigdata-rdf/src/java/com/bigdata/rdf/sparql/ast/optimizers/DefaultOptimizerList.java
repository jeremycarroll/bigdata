/**
 * Pre-populated list of the default optimizers.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * optimizerList.add(new BindingAssigner()); // done.
 * optimizerList.add(new ConstantOptimizer(strategy));
 * optimizerList.add(new CompareOptimizer());
 * optimizerList.add(new ConjunctiveConstraintSplitter());
 * optimizerList.add(new SameTermFilterOptimizer());
 * // only need to optimize the join order this way if we are not
 * // using native joins
 * if (nativeJoins == false) {
 *     optimizerList.add(new QueryJoinOptimizer(new BigdataEvaluationStatistics(
 *             this)));
 * }
 * optimizerList.add(new FilterOptimizer());
 * optimizerList.optimize(tupleExpr, dataset, bindings);
 * replaceValues(dataset, tupleExpr, bindings); // yes.
 * </pre>
 * 
 * FIXME {@link ConstantOptimizer}. Rewrites the query replacing any aspect
 * which can be statically evaluated to a constant with that constant. The
 * implementation considers variables, functions, and constants.
 * 
 * FIXME {@link CompareOptimizer}. Replaces Compare with SameTerm whenever
 * possible. (I think that we handle this in the {@link FunctionRegistry}, but
 * that should be verified and documented here.)
 * 
 * FIXME {@link ConjunctiveConstraintSplitter}. Takes a FILTER with an AND of
 * constraints and replaces it with one filter per left or right hand side of
 * the AND. This flattens the value expression hierarchy. It also might allow us
 * to reject some solutions earlier in the pipeline since we do not have to wait
 * for all of the variables to become bound and we can potentially evaluate some
 * of the individual constraints earlier than others.
 * 
 * FIXME {@link SameTermFilterOptimizer}. Optimizes SameTerm(X,Y) by renaming
 * one of the variables to the other variable. Optimizes SameTerm(X,aURI) by
 * assigning the constant to the variable.
 * 
 * FIXME {@link FilterOptimizer}. Pushes filters as far down in the query model
 * as possible. (What purpose does this serve for us? We want to attach filters
 * to the first required join where they can possible by evaluated.)
 * 
 * FIXME Sesame has define a bunch of IQueryOptimizers that we are not using
 * (even before this refactor). Many of them apply to their SQL backends. A few
 * might be relevant to us:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link DisjunctiveConstraintOptimizer} - moves SameTerm closer to joins
 * for queries involving UNIONs.</li>
 * <li>{@link IterativeEvaluationOptimizer} - ???</li>
 * <li>{@link QueryModelNormalizer} - various simplifications of their tuple
 * expression query model. I am not sure whether or not there is anything here
 * we could leverage.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * TODO Recognize OR of constraints and rewrite as IN. We can then optimize the
 * IN operator in a variety of ways (in fact, the {@link FunctionRegistry}
 * already handles those optimizations for IN).
 * 
 * TODO The combination of DISTINCT and ORDER BY can be optimized using an ORDER
 * BY in which duplicate solutions are discarded after the sort by a filter
 * which compares the current solution with the prior solution.
 * 
 * TODO AST optimizer to turn SELECT DISTINCT ?p WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } into a
 * DistinctTermScan? (We are doing something very similar for GRAPH ?g {}).
 * 
 * TODO A query with a LIMIT of ZERO (0) should be failed as there will be no
 * solutions.
 * 
 * TODO Minor optimization: A bare constant in the ORDER BY value expression
 * list should be dropped. If there are no remaining value expressions, then the
 * entire ORDER BY operation should be dropped.
 * 
 * FIXME Write AST optimizer which rejects queries that SELECT variables which
 * do not otherwise appear in the query.
 * 
 * TODO If a child group is non-optional and not a union, then flatten it out
 * (lift it into the parent). (This sort of thing is not directly expressible in
 * the SPARQL syntax but it might arise through other AST transforms.)
