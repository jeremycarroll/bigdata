 * Abstract base class for rules with two terms in the tail where one term is

 * variable.  The examples are:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * rdfs2: triple(u rdf:type x) :- triple(a rdfs:domain x),        triple(u a y).
 * 
 * rdfs3: triple(v rdf:type x) :- triple(a rdfs:range  x),        triple(u a v).
 * 
 * rdfs7: triple(u b        y) :- triple(a rdfs:subPropertyOf b), triple(u a y).
 * 
 * rdfs9: triple(v rdf:type x) :- triple(u rdfs:subClassOf x),    triple(v rdf:type u).                                                         
 * </pre>

 * FIXME I need to factor the logic for executing this rule out of the rule instance
 * so that I can use the same logic with different variable names.
