/**
 * @todo Should we run this rule or backchain?
 *       <p>
 *       [MikeP] I would say generate, but you can backchain (I think?) as long
 *       as you have the full closure of the type hierarchy, specifically of ?
 *       type Class. If you don't have that (i.e. if you are not calculating the
 *       domain and range inferences), then you'd need to recursively backchain
 *       the tail too. That is why I did not do more backchaining - the
 *       backchain for ? type Resource is super easy because it's never longer
 *       than 1 move back.
