/**
 * An class that facilitates maintaining the RDF(S)+ closure on a database as
 * statements are asserted or retracted. One instance of this class should be
 * created for statements to be asserted against the database. Another instance
 * should be created for statements to be retracted from the database. In each
 * case, the caller writes on the {@link IStatementBuffer} interface, which will
 * overflow into a {@link TempTripleStore} maintained by this class. When all
 * data have been buffered, the caller invokes {@link #doClosure()}, which will
 * either assert or retract the statements from the database while maintaining
 * the RDF(S)+ closure over the database. Whether statements are asserted or
 * retracted depends on a constructor parameter.
 * 
 * @todo for concurrent data writers, this class should probably allocate an
 *       {@link RdfKeyBuilder} provisioned according to the target database and
 *       attach it to the {@link StatementBuffer}. Alternatively, have the
 *       {@link StatementBuffer} do that. In either case, the batch API on the
 *       {@link AbstractTripleStore} should then use the {@link RdfKey`Builder}
 *       attached to the {@link StatementBuffer}.

     * <p>
     * Note: When this is first called, the tempStore SHOULD contain only those
     * statements that were known to be explicit statements in the database.
     * However, when this is invoked recursively the tempStore will contain only
     * inferred statements -- these are statements that are part of the closure
     * of the original statements that were retracted and whose grounded
     * justifications we are now seeking. Regardless of whether this is invoke
     * with the explicitly given set of statements to retracted or (recursively)
     * with inferences that may need to be retracted, the statements in the
     * tempStore MUST still in the database (they should have been copied to the
     * tempStore, not removed from the database).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The steps are:
     * <ol>
     * 
     * <li> Create a focusStore into which we will write all statements that
     * will not be grounded once the statements in the tempStore have been
     * deleted from the database. In the first pass this will contain the
     * original explicit statements which are no longer provable. In subsequent
     * (recursive) passes it will contain any inferences drawn from those
     * statements which are themselves no longer provable.</li>
     * 
     * <li> For each statement in the tempStore, determine whether or not it is
     * has a grounded justification chain. If yes, then change the statement
     * type to inferred in the database and we are done with that statement.
     * </li>
     * 
     * <li> If there is no grounded justification chain for a statement then it
     * gets put into a {@link SPOAssertionBuffer} writing on the focusStore and
     * into an {@link SPORetractionBuffer} writing on the database (so that the
     * statement and its {@link Justification}s get deleted from the database).
     * </li>
     * 
     * <li> Once all statements in the tempStore have been processed we flush
     * the various buffers and {@link TempTripleStore#closeAndDelete()} the
     * tempStore. </li>
     * 
     * <li> We then compute the closure of the focusStore against the database
     * in order to discover additional statements that may no longer be
     * supported and hence will have to be retracted. This closure operation is
     * similar to the incremental load closure but with two twists: (1) we do
     * NOT generate {@link Justification} chains; and (2) we do NOT copy the
     * result onto the database - instead we leave it in the focusStore. </li>
     * 
     * <li> Once we have the new set of statements to consider for retraction we
     * simply invoke retractAll() again on that focusStore. </li>
     * 
     * </ol>
     * </p>

     *            explicit statements to be retracted.
