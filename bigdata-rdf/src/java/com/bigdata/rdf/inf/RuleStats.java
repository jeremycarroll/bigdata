/**
 * Statistics about what the Rule did.
 * 
 * @todo it would be nice to report the #of new entailments and not just the #of
 *       computed entailments. The {@link SPOAssertionBuffer} knows how many new
 *       entailments are written each time the buffer is
 *       {@link SPOAssertionBuffer#flush()}ed. However, the buffer can be
 *       flushed more than once during the execution of the rule, so we need to
 *       aggregate those counts across flushes and then reset once the rule is
 *       done. Also note that we sometimes defer a flush across rules if only a
 *       few entailments were generated, so correct reporting would mean
 *       modifying that practice.
