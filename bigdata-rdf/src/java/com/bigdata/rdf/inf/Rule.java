/**
 * 
 * @todo Since a variable is just a negative long integer, it is possible to
 *       encode a predicate just like we do a statement with an added flag
 *       either before or after the s:p:o keys indicating whether the
 *       predicate is a magic/1 or a triple/3. This means that we can store
 *       predicates directly in the database in a manner that is consistent
 *       with triples. Since we can store predicates directly in the
 *       database we can also store rules simply be adding the body of the
 *       rule as the value associated with the predicate key. This will let
 *       us combine the rule base, the magic predicates, and the answer set
 *       together. We can then use the existing btree operations for access.
 *       The answer set can be extracted by filtering out the rules. (We
 *       should probably partition the keys so that rules are always in a
 *       disjoint part of the key space, e.g., by including a leading byte
 *       that is 0 for a triple and 1 for a rule.)
