/**
 * Adds support for RDFS inference.
  * <p>
 * A fact always has the form:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * triple(s, p, o)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * where s, p, and or are identifiers for RDF values in the {@link TermIndex}.
 * Facts are stored either in the long-term database or in a per-query answer
 * set.
 * <p>
 * A rule always has the form:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   pred :- pred*.
 * </pre>
 * 
 * where <i>pred</i> is either
 * <code>magic(triple(varOrId,varOrId,varOrId))</code> or
 * <code>triple(varOrId,varOrId,varOrId)</code>. A rule is a clause
 * consisting of a head (a predicate) and a body (one or more predicates). Note
 * that the body of the rule MAY be empty. When there are multiple predicates in
 * the body of a rule the rule succeeds iff all predicates in the body succeed.
 * When a rule succeeds, the head of the clause is asserted. If the head is a
 * predicate then it is asserted into the rule base for the query. If it is a
 * fact, then it is asserted into the database for the query. Each predicate has
 * an "arity" with is the number of arguments, e.g., the predicate "triple" has
 * an arity of 3 and may be written as triple/3 while the predicate "magic" has
 * an arity of 1 and may be written as magic/1.
 * <p>
 * A copy is made of the basic rule base at the start of each query and a magic
 * transform is applied to the rule base, producing a new rule base that is
 * specific to the query. Each query is also associated with an answer set in
 * which facts are accumulated. Query execution consists of iteratively applying
 * all rules in the rule base. Execution terminates when no new facts or rules
 * are asserted in a given iteration - this is the <i>fixed point</i> of the
 * query.
 * <p>
 * Note: it is also possible to run the rule set without creating a magic
 * transform. This will produce the full forward closure of the entailments.
 * This is done by using the statements loaded from some source as the source
 * fact base and inserting the entailments created by the rules back into
 * statement collection. When the rules reach their fixed point, the answer set
 * contains both the told triples and the inferred triples and is simply
 * inserted into the long-term database.
 * <p>
 * rdfs9 is represented as:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    triple(?v,rdf:type,?x) :-
 *       triple(?u,rdfs:subClassOf,?x),
 *       triple(?v,rdf:type,?u). 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * rdfs11 is represented as:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    triple(?u,rdfs:subClassOf,?x) :-
 *       triple(?u,rdfs:subClassOf,?v),
 *       triple(?v,rdf:subClassOf,?x).
