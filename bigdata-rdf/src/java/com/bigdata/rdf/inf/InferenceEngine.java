/**
 * Adds support for RDFS inference.
 * <p>
 * A fact always has the form:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * triple(s, p, o)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * where s, p, and or are identifiers for RDF values in the terms index. Facts
 * are stored either in the long-term database or in a per-query answer set.
 * <p>
 * A rule always has the form:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *                          pred :- pred*.
 * </pre>
 * 
 * where <i>pred</i> is either
 * <code>magic(triple(varOrId,varOrId,varOrId))</code> or
 * <code>triple(varOrId,varOrId,varOrId)</code>. A rule is a clause
 * consisting of a head (a predicate) and a body (one or more predicates). Note
 * that the body of the rule MAY be empty. When there are multiple predicates in
 * the body of a rule the rule succeeds iff all predicates in the body succeed.
 * When a rule succeeds, the head of the clause is asserted. If the head is a
 * predicate then it is asserted into the rule base for the query. If it is a
 * fact, then it is asserted into the database for the query. Each predicate has
 * an "arity" with is the number of arguments, e.g., the predicate "triple" has
 * an arity of 3 and may be written as triple/3 while the predicate "magic" has
 * an arity of 1 and may be written as magic/1.
 * <p>
 * A copy is made of the basic rule base at the start of each query and a magic
 * transform is applied to the rule base, producing a new rule base that is
 * specific to the query. Each query is also associated with an answer set in
 * which facts are accumulated. Query execution consists of iteratively applying
 * all rules in the rule base. Execution terminates when no new facts or rules
 * are asserted in a given iteration - this is the <i>fixed point</i> of the
 * query.
 * <p>
 * Note: it is also possible to run the rule set without creating a magic
 * transform. This will produce the full forward closure of the entailments.
 * This is done by using the statements loaded from some source as the source
 * fact base and inserting the entailments created by the rules back into
 * statement collection. When the rules reach their fixed point, the answer set
 * contains both the told triples and the inferred triples and is simply
 * inserted into the long-term database.
 * <p>
 * rdfs9 is represented as:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *                           triple(?v,rdf:type,?x) :-
 *                              triple(?u,rdfs:subClassOf,?x),
 *                              triple(?v,rdf:type,?u). 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * rdfs11 is represented as:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *                           triple(?u,rdfs:subClassOf,?x) :-
 *                              triple(?u,rdfs:subClassOf,?v),

 * FIXME Provide incremental closure of data sets are they are loaded.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Rule} class needs to be modified to accept a "new" (statements
 * being loaded or removed from the database) and "db" (either the database
 * (during TM for statement removal) or the union of the new and the database
 * (when adding statements)) parameter and to automatically appy() the rule N
 * times, where N is the #of terms in the tail. In each pass, tail[i] is
 * designated as reading from the "new" data and the other terms in the tail
 * read from the "old" data. This can be done by a variant of apply(). The
 * results are read as a union over the passes, e.g., as an {@link ISPOIterator}.
 * On each pass, the rule should do a rangeCount and execute the individual
 * terms as subqueries where the most selective subquery is run first.
 * <p>
 * 
 * @todo refactor rules to isolate each subquery so that we can choose the
 *       execution order dynamically based on the selectivity of the different
 *       subqueries.
 *       <p>
 *       This will also require that we declare the joins, e.g.,
 *       <code>term[i].s = term[j].p</code> so that we can execute the join
 *       correctly regardless of the order in which we execute the subqueries.
 * 
 * @todo maintain an instance SPO[] in each rule for the bindings. Copy the
 *       static bindings across when the rule is initialized. Define the joins
 *       in terms of variables used in the body[] and then map those variables
 *       into the term[i] index and the {s,p,o} position on the bindings[].
 * 
 * @todo the RuleStats should collect data on a per term-in-the-tail basis.
 * 
 * @todo support subquery reuse.
 * 
 * @todo refactor rules to define apply() that maps over the terms collecting
 *       the union of the results when executing the rule with each term in turn
 *       reading from the "new" vs the "dbView". Note that the "dbView" is
 *       either just the db or a fused view of the db and "new".
 * 
 * @todo tests of the rule mapping logic and tests of the sub-queries. The rule
 *       execution is now going to be refactored into some logic for choosing
 *       the term execution order and unioning the results, so that can get
 *       tested by itself and then the various rules should work correctly if
 *       they are using the correct triple patterns and join variables.
 * 
 * FIXME truth maintenance (check the SAIL also).
 * 
 * FIXME rdfs:Resource by backward chaining on query. This means that we need a
 * query wrapper for the store or for the inference engine.
 * 
 * FIXME owl:sameAs by backward chaining on query.
 * 
 * @todo We don’t do owl:equivalentClass and owl:equivalentProperty currently.
 *       You can simulate those by doing a bi-directional subClassOf or
 *       subPropertyOf, which has always sufficed for our purposes. If you were
 *       going to write rules for those two things this is how you would do it:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   equivalentClass:
 *                              
 *   add an axiom to the KB: equivalentClass subPropertyOf subClassOf
 *  
 *   add an entailment rule: xxx equivalentClass yyy -&gt; yyy equivalentClass xxx
 * </pre>
 * 
 * It would be analogous for equivalentProperty.
 * 
 * @todo Option to turn off range/domain processing.
 * 
 * @todo Improve write efficiency for the proofs - they are slowing things way
 *       down.
 * 
 * @todo provide option for "owl:sameAs" semantics using destructive merging
 *       (the terms are assigned the same term identifier, one of them is
 *       treated as a canonical, and there is no way to retract the sameAs
 *       assertion).
 * 
 * @todo experiment with use of a bloom filter
 * 
 * @todo provide fixed point transitive closure for "chain" rules (subClassOf)
 * 
 * @todo if we are not storing rules or magic facts in the main statement
 *       indices then get rid of the leading byte used in all keys for the
 *       statement indices.
