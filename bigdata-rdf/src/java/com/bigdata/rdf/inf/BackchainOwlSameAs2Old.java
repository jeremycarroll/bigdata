/**
 * Backchains {@link RuleOwlSameAs2} given triple pattern (s p o).
 * <p>
 * Approach:
 * 
 * <p>
 * Stage 1: we deliver all results from the source iterator collecting up the
 * set of distinct subjects in a {@link BTree} backed by a
 * {@link TemporaryRawStore} and updating a {@link BloomFilter} whose key is the
 * statement's fully bound term identifiers in SPO order.
 * <p>
 * Stage 2: we do an ordered read on the {@link BTree}. for each distinct
 * subject <code>s</code>, we issue a query <code>(s owl:sameAs y)</code>,
 * collecting up the set <code>Y</code>, where <code>y != s</code> of
 * resources that are the same as that subject. (We do not actually need to
 * collect that set - its members can be visited incrementally.)
 * <p>
 * Stage 3: For each <code>y</code> in <code>Y</code> we obtain an iterator
 * reading on <code>(y p o)</code> where <code>p</code> and <code>o</code>
 * are the predicate and object specified to the constructor and MAY be unbound.
 * For each statement visited by that iterator we test the bloom filter. If it
 * reports NO then this statement does NOT duplicate a statement visited in
 * Stage 1 and we deliver it via {@link #next()}. If it reports YES then this
 * statement MAY duplicate a statement delivered in Stage 1 and we add it into
 * an {@link ISPOBuffer}.
 * <p>
 * When the {@link ISPOBuffer} overflows we sort it and perform an ordered
 * existence test on the database. If the statement is found in the database
 * then it is discarded from the buffer. The remaining statements in the buffer
 * are then delivered via {@link #next()}.
 * <p>
 * Note: This assumes that backchaining can only discover duplicates of
 * statements delivered by the source iterator and NOT duplicates of statements
 * discovered by backchaining itself. If this is NOT true then you need to add
 * each backchained statement to the {@link BloomFilter} as well and we will
 * also need to explicitly track every single statement that we backchain so
 * that we can filter duplicates.
 * <p>
 * Note: This assumes that the reflexive ({@link RuleOwlSameAs1}) and
 * transitive ({@link RuleOwlSameAs1b}) closure of <code>owl:sameAs</code>
 * is maintained on the database.
 * 
 * @todo are there simplifications if <code>s</code> is bound that are worth
 *       pursuing?
 * 
 * @todo an alterative to all this logic is to dump everything into an SPO index
 *       on a temporary store and then stream the results from that index once
 *       the source iterator and the entailments are exhausted.
 * 
 * @todo write high-level test reading triple patterns from a database using
 *       this and other backchaining iterators and verify that each chunk is
 *       correctly sorted. it is not critical that the sequences of chunks are
 *       fully ordered, but the chunks themselves should be fully ordered (and
 *       should not contain any duplicates).
 * 
 * @todo decide how to nest (x type resource) and owl:sameAs backward chainers.
 *       if there is an explicit (x type resource) and (y owl:sameAs x) in the
 *       kb then running the (x type resource) backward chainer over the
 *       owl:sameAs backward chainer could fool the former based on the tests
 *       that it performs against the kb for duplicates.
