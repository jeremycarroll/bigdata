/**
 * A triple store based on the <em>bigdata</em> architecture. This class
 * offers extremely low latency for index operations. All indices are local
 * (in-process) objects and there are no concurrency controls, so point tests on
 * the indices are extremely efficient. Significant parallelism is achieved by
 * paying careful attention to the concurrency constraints imposed by the
 * {@link BTree} class (writers are single threaded, reads may be concurrent,
 * but not concurrent with a writer) and by using different views (unisolated vs
 * read-historical) of the indices when computing entailments or performing
 * high-level query.
