     * The name of a per-statement attribute whose value is recognized in

     * element on which it appears. The <code>bigdata:sid</code> attribute is
     * allowed on elements describing RDF statements and serves as a
     * per-statement identifier. The value of the <code>bigdata:sid</code>
     * attribute must conform to the syntactic constraints of a blank node. By
     * re-using the value of the <code>bigdata:sid</code> attribute within
     * other statements in the same RDF/XML document, the client can express
     * statements about the statements.
     * <p>
     * This RDF/XML extension allows us to inline provenance (statements about
     * statements) with RDF/XML to clients in a manner which has minor impact on
     * unaware clients (they will perceive additional statements whose predicate
     * is <code>bigdata:sid</code>). In addition, clients aware of this
     * extension can submit RDF/XML with inline provenance.
     * <p>
     * For example:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://www.foo.org/A&quot;&gt;
     *     &lt;label bigdata:sid=&quot;_S67&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&quot;&gt;abc&lt;/label&gt;
