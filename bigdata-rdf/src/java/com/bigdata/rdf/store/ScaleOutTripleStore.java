/**
 * Implementation of an {@link ITripleStore} as a client of a
 * {@link BigdataFederation}. The implementation supports a scale-out
 * architecture in which each index may have one or more partitions. Index
 * partitions are multiplexed onto {@link IDataService}s.
 * <p>
 * The client uses unisolated writes against the lexicon (terms and ids indices)
 * and the statement indices. The index writes are automatically broken down
 * into one split per index partition. While each unisolated write on an index
 * partition is ACID, the indices are fully consistent iff the total operation
 * is successfull. For the lexicon, this means that the write on the terms and
 * the ids index must both succeed. For the statement indices, this means that
 * the write on each access path must succeed. If a client fails while adding
 * terms, then it is possible for the ids index to be incomplete with respect to
 * the terms index (i.e., terms are mapped into the lexicon and term identifiers
 * are assigned but the reverse lookup by term identifier will not discover the
 * term). Likewise, if a client fails while adding statements, then it is
 * possible for some of the access paths to be incomplete with respect to the
 * other access paths (i.e., some statements are not present in some access
 * paths).
 * <p>
 * Two additional mechanisms are used in order to guarentee reads from only
 * fully consistent data. First, clients providing query answering should read
 * from a database state that is known to be consistent (by using a read-only
 * transaction whose start time is the globally agreed upon commit time for that
 * database state). Second, if a client operation fails then it must be retried.
 * Such fail-safe retry semantics are available when data load operations are
 * executed as part of a map-reduce job.
 * <p>
 * 
 * @todo provide a mechanism to make document loading robust to client failure.
 *       When loads are unisolated, a client failure can result in the
 *       statements being loaded into only a subset of the statement indices.
 *       robust load would require a means for undo or redo of failed loads. a
 *       loaded based on map/reduce would naturally provide a robust mechanism
 *       using a redo model.
 * 
 * @todo run various tests against all implementations and tune up the network
 *       protocol. Examine dictinary and hamming codes and parallelization of
 *       operations. Write a distributed join.
 * 
 * @todo Each unisolated write results in a commit. This means that a single
 *       client will run more slowly since it must perform more commits when
 *       loading the data. However, if we support group commit on the data
 *       service then that will have a big impact on concurrent load rates since
 *       multiple clients can write on the same data service before the next
 *       commit. (This does not work for a single client since the write must
 *       commit before control returns to the client.)
 * 
 * @todo test consistent concurrent load.
 * 
 * @todo test query (LUBM).
 * 
 * @todo provide read against historical state and periodically notify clients
 *       when there is a new historical state that is complete (data are loaded
 *       and closure exists). this will prevent partial reads of data during
 *       data load.
 * 
 * @todo Very large bulk data load (using the {@link BulkRioLoader} to load
 *       {@link IndexSegment} directly). Reconcile as of the commit time of the
 *       bulk insert and you get to do that using efficient compacting
 *       sort-merges of "perfect" bulk index segments.
 * 
 * @todo write utility class to create and pre-partition a federated store.
