	 * 11.2.2 Effective Boolean Value (EBV)
	 * 
	 * Effective boolean value is used to calculate the arguments to the logical
	 * functions logical-and, logical-or, and fn:not, as well as evaluate the
	 * result of a FILTER expression.
	 * 
	 * The XQuery Effective Boolean Value rules rely on the definition of
	 * XPath's fn:boolean. The following rules reflect the rules for fn:boolean
	 * applied to the argument types present in SPARQL Queries:
	 * 
	 * The EBV of any literal whose type is xsd:boolean or numeric is false if
	 * the lexical form is not valid for that datatype (e.g.
	 * "abc"^^xsd:integer).
	 * 
	 * If the argument is a typed literal with a datatype of xsd:boolean, the
	 * EBV is the value of that argument.
	 * 
	 * If the argument is a plain literal or a typed literal with a datatype of
	 * xsd:string, the EBV is false if the operand value has zero length;
	 * otherwise the EBV is true.
	 * 
	 * If the argument is a numeric type or a typed literal with a datatype
	 * derived from a numeric type, the EBV is false if the operand value is NaN
	 * or is numerically equal to zero; otherwise the EBV is true.
	 * 
	 * All other arguments, including unbound arguments, produce a type error.
	 * 
	 * An EBV of true is represented as a typed literal with a datatype of
	 * xsd:boolean and a lexical value of "true"; an EBV of false is represented
	 * as a typed literal with a datatype of xsd:boolean and a lexical value of
	 * "false".
