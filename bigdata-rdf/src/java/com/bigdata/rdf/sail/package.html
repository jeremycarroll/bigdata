<title>Sesame 1.x SAIL integration</title>

<p>
This package provides a Sesame 1.x integration using the SAIL.  This is very
much a trial balloon.  Sesame 1.x coupled the control logic and data structures
in such a way that you could not write your own JOIN operators, which makes it
very difficult to optimize performance.  An option is provided to turn on a
simple (and not very well tested) eager closure solution without truth maintenance.
A custom integration is provided for directly loading data into the triple store
with throughput of 20,000+ triples per second - see the com.bigdata.rdf.rio
package and {@link com.bigdata.rdf.TripleStore}.
