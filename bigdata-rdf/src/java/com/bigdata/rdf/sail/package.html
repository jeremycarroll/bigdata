<p>
This package is developing an alternative bigdata integration suitable for
scale-out on commodity hardware.  The original integration was tightly coupled
to an embedded bigdata instance and used unisolatable indices that were responsible
for (de-)serializing and storing terms and statements.  This integration uses
scale-out indices, which accept variable length unsigned byte[] keys and byte[]
values.  The client is responsible for (de-)serialization of values, which is
mainly of interest for the terms and ids indices.  This integration also respects
the client-data services divide.
