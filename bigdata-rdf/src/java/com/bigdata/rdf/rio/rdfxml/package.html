<p>

	This package provides an extension of the openrdf RDF/XML parser which
	supports SIDs mode interchange and the interchange of the {explicit,
	inferred, axiom} statement metadata.  This package was derived from the
	<code>org.openrdf.rio.rdfxml</code> package and adheres to the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/">revised RDF/XML
    syntax specification of 10 February 2004</a> with the bigdata specific
    extensions.
