 * @param <ES>
 *            The generic type for the per-edge state. This is scoped to the
 *            computation of the {@link IGASProgram}.
 * @param <ST>
 *            The generic type for the SUM. This is often directly related to
 *            the generic type for the per-edge state, but that is not always
 *            true. The SUM type is scoped to the GATHER + SUM operation (NOT
 *            the computation).

 *            FIXME This should be refactored to allow a singleton for the
 *            {@link IGASEngine} (for a server process, much like a QueryEngine)
 *            and then to create an {@link IGASContext} to execute an
 *            {@link IGASProgram}. This would allow us to reuse resources within
 *            the {@link IGASEngine}.
