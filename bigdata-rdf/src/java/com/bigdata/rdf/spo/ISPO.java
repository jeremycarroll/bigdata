/**
 * A interface representing an RDF triple, an RDF triple with a statement
 * identifier, or an RDF quad. The slots are 64-bit <code>long</code> term
 * identifiers assigned by a lexicon. The 4th position is either unused
 * (triples), the statement identifier (triples with the provenance mode
 * enabled), or the context/named graph position of a quad. This interface
 * treats all four positions as "data" and requires the caller to be aware of
 * the database mode (triples, triples+SIDs, or quads). The (s,p,o) of the
 * interface are immutable. The (c) position is mutable because its value is not
 * knowable until after the other three values have been bound in the
 * triples+SIDs database mode. When using this interface for a quads mode
 * database, the context position SHOULD be set by the appropriate constructor
 * and NOT modified thereafter.
 * <p>
 * Two additional data are carried by this interface for use with inference and
 * truth maintenance. First, this interface may also carry an indication of
 * whether the triple/quad is an explicit statement, an inferred statement or an
 * axiom. Second, the {@link #isOverride()} flag is used during truth
 * maintenance when an explicit statement is retracted and we need to downgrade
 * the statement in the database to an inference because it is still provable by
 * other statements in the knowledge base.
