		 * This is the fixed length hash code prefix. When a collision

		 * increasing the #of bits from the hash code which are used to
		 * create a distinction in the index. Records with identical hash
		 * values are stored in an (unordered, and possibly chained) bucket.
		 * We can approximate this by using N-bits of the hash code for the
		 * key and then increasing the #of bits in the key when there is a
		 * hash collision. Unless a hash function is used which has
		 * sufficient bits available to ensure that there are no collisions,
		 * we may be forced eventually to append a counter to impose a
		 * distinction among records which are hash identical but whose
		 * values differ.
		 * 
		 * In the case of a hash collision, we can determine the records
		 * which have already collided using the fast range count between
		 * the hash code key and the fixed length successor of that key. We
		 * can create a guaranteed distinct key by creating a BigInteger
		 * whose values is (#collisions+1) and appending it to the key. This
		 * approach will give us keys whose byte length increases slowly as
		 * the #of collisions grows (though these might not be the minimum
		 * length keys - depending on how we are encoding the BigInteger in
		 * the key.)
		 * 
		 * When we have a hash collision, we first need to scan all of the
		 * collision records and make sure that none of those records has
		 * the same value as the given record. This is done using the fixed
		 * length successor of the hash code key as the exclusive upper
		 * bound of a key range scan. Each record associated with a tuple in
