Issues to be resolved in this branch.

1. Done. Re-design of the node/leaf API to support processing of
   serialized nodes and leaves without materializing their contents as
   java objects.  Nodes and leaves are now expanded into Java objects
   iff a mutation needs to be performed on the node or leaf.

2. Global record or B+Tree node/leaf record buffering for a DS.  This
   allows us to efficiently use all available RAM to buffer the
   indices.

3. Store level record compression.

   See com.bigdata.io.compression as well as
   com.bigdata.btree.raba.codec.TestHuffmanEncoder, NodeSerializer,
   and IndexSegmentBuilder.

4. Dependency refactor (fastutil, dsiutils, lgpl-utils).

5. Performance optimizations for the B+Tree refactor change set,
   including the performance tuning for the rabas, the LRU buffer,
   configurations, etc.

--------------------

Query optimization

x. Parallel range iterator flag.

x. Resolve RDF Values using JOINs.

x. Distributed join optimization (performance tuning, hot spot
   elimination, configuration parameter tuning, etc).

--------------------

Index partition splits.

   - Proactive scheduling

   - Faster.  The best solution is to split after a compacting merge
     since we have exact knowledge of the tuple counts and exact
     knowledge of the on disk storage requirements at that time.

   - More robust (transactional)

   - Based on #of bytes in post-merge file (no need to tweak,
     radically simplifies life).

--------------------

Full tx support for RDF

     - In the BigdataSail?

     - In the OpenAnzo data source.

     - Verify transactional create of indices and kb.

     - Non-tx writes MUST assign a revision timestamp if they are
       targeting an index which supports transactions and on which
       transactions may have already written data.  The revision
       timestamp can be a timestamp associated with the task holding
       the lock on the index.

     - TM can be done as an extension of the tx processing.  Just
       bring the tx write set to a fixed point, then resolve conflicts
       during validation and merge down for the commit.

     - Parallel validating and merge down during the commit protocol
       for all indices isolated by the tx.  This will reduce the tx
       commit latency, which is critical.

     - Reconcile adds but reject conflicting retractions.

     - Connection point for disconnected synchronization.

     - Connection point for state change listener on Statement and its
       type {inferred, explicit}.

     - Extend API to report the revision timestamp for a tx.

     - Log tx commit times together with their associated revision
       timestamps.

     - Performance tuning for timestamp[] coding.

     - Option to provision KB to support transactions.

     - TERM2ID and ID2TERM will be non-transactional.  How about the
       text index?

     - Integration point for migrating recent history onto a new
       journal and either migrating sufficiently journals to tertiary
       storage or releasing them.  This provides an immortal database
       option for an application with a moderate steady state and
       ongoing transients.  This does not work for applications which
       only grow their comitted set size.

     - Global LRU.  This really needs to be isolated to a specific tx
       so we can discard records from the LRU if the tx aborts.

--------------------

Distributed Tx

     - Distributed tx protocol.

     - Failover for tx service.

     - Write sets must stick with their corresponding index partition.

     - How can we retain low tx latency during index partition (split,
       move, join) operations?

     - Bottlenecks
     
     - The IsolatedFusedView's tuple cursor needs to override remove()
       in order to propagate the tuple revision timestamp correctly.
       See AbstractBTreeTupleCursor#remove().

     - Unit tests to verify correct propagation of version timestamps
       for index segments and views.

--------------------
HA

     - The logical DS identifier should be just the zk node/path for
       the logical DS.  That gives us direct lookup in zk of the
       physical DS instances and their order is the failover chain.
       An alternative would be to store the logical DS UUID in the
       data for the logical DS zpath and cache the reverse resolution
       (UUID to LDS).

     - The time to start a new PDS for an LDS will be quite large as
       we need to replicate all the state of the existing LDS.  The
       state could be read from any of the existing PDS for that LDS,
       or from a combination of those instances.

     - Integration for backup.

     - Integration point for migrating old history (journals and index
       segments) onto tertiary storage.

--------------------
Monitoring.  

Look at how MonALISA handles large numbers of clients and large scale
monitoring, including proxying for WAN connections.  An integration
with MonALISA would be great, but would be restricted to commercial
users due to their own licensing.

--------------------
Sync of disconnected clients:

Offhand, I see three ways of approaching this.  One is to simply log
the deltas and replay the log to the client.  Another is to store
version timestamps on the tuples and use a scan to identify the change
set, or alternatively to scan the two B+Tree revisions in parallel,
reporting only the delta (tuples found in one index but not the
other), where a tuple would correspond to an SPO(C).  If we go with
the per-tuple revision timestamp, but also store the most current
tuple revision timestamp on the ancestor nodes (these are always
touched when we update a descendent), then we can prune the search on
any node/leaf whose largest revision timestamp is LT then starting
revision required to sync the client.

The revision timestamp is LT the commit timestamp since revision
timestamps are assigned at the start of the commit protocol, while the
commit timestamp is assigned once the write sets have been reconciled,
the indices have been checkpointed, and all is good for the commit,
which just updates the root block.  Revision timestamps on a given
B+Tree will be totally ordered for concurrent transactions since the
commit protocol has an exclusive lock on the unisolated B+Tree view.
Since we would be working with revision timestamps rather than commit
timestamps, I could either extend the transaction service to allow
reporting of the assigned revision timestamp, or it could be obtained
by an after action read on the root of the B+Tree using the commit
time of the transaction.  Tuple revision timestamps and delete markers
are automatically maintained by the transaction commit protocol.

This approach would do much less work since we would basically skip
any node (and all dominated leaves) which had not been updated since
the starting revision for the sync.  New statements would be
associated with tuples having a revision timestamp GT the starting
revision time for the sync.  Deleted statements would be identified by
the presence of a tuple with a delete marker having a revision
timestamp GT the starting revision for the sync.

If it sounds like that would do what you want, I can think about how
to raise that information up into a filter on the B+Tree iterators and
from there to the KB layer.  If we did this for the SPO(C) index, then
you could resolve those tuples to RDF Statements and push them to the
client.  The application would need a log of the revision timestamps
associated with the commit timestamps so it could use the former to
sync clients and the latter to read from a historical commit point.
Probably the transaction service could be extended to retain that
information for a temporal store.

Scale-out for a temporal store will require the ability to patch the
MDI (or maybe just the logical to physical DS mapping) with the new
locations of index partitions which are moved due to machine failure.

--------------------

Asynchronous notification of RDF change sets (deltas).

There is some interest in a feature which would report on the change
sets for the RDF database.  E.g., triples added or removed.  In the
case of truth maintenance, this might also include the state change
for triples between "explicit" and "inference".

For the current SAIL, we could extract bit flags for each triple
written on (or retracted from) the database indicating for that triple
whether or not the database was modified (e.g., whether it was already
present when added or whether it was not present when retracted).  We
would do this for just one of the statement indices -- probably the
SPO index.  This information could be reported via an asynchronous
listener mechanism each time a chunk of RDF statements is flushed to
the database.  This might be a few days effort.

When performing truth maintenance, we fix point a temporary triple
store until it contains the statements to be added to (or removed
from) the database.  This can include explicit statements which become
inferences, or inferences which are no longer supported and are fully
retracted.  In this case, it would be possible to report statements
which were added, removed, or whose status as inferences or explicit
statements was changed by the operations.  This is a bit more work.

Doing this for transactions would require an extension to the commit
protocol since the events would occur during the "merge down" of the
transaction write set onto the unisolated indices.  If the "statement
change set" events are to be ACID, then we will have to log the events
and play them back to the listener as an after action on the commit.
That way the listener would have a guarantee that the persistent state
change was in fact committed.  That log might be a restart safe queue,
so a listener could ensure that they observed all state changes. If we
mark the commit time associated with a set of logged changes, then a
listener could survive restart and request a reply of the change sets
since some historical commit time.  Those events would be in terms of
the internal keys of the statement index, which are essentially
long[3] and correspond to the Subject, Predicate, and Object positions
of a triple.  Those keys could be resolved to an RDF Statement, and
the application would set the change set as RDF Statements.  For truth
maintenance, we would also log the change in the statement type
(explicit, inference).  Handling change set notification for
transactions is clearly more complex.

By doing this at the database layer we should be able to report events
even when concurrent operations insert the same triples without
duplicate events.  Change set detection would also work for scale-out,
but a proxy for the listener would have to be registered with each
data service.

The more complex approach would be if you were using native (bigdata)
transactions, wanted the notifications to have the same ACID semantics
as the transaction. E.g., the application would never see a change set
unless the transaction was successfully committed to disk, and
required a guarantee that you eventually saw all change sets.

You could still do the "bit flag" route with the clustered backend,
but you would need to register proxies for listeners at each bigdata
node on the cluster.

-------------------- 
Examples:

 - Example showing use of the {@link KeyBuilder} (and DDL?)
  
 - Example showing how to use the scale-out indices efficiently with
   {@link IIndexProcedure}s. this approach is necessary when you need
   to do complex logic which would otherwise result in a large volume
   of point tests against the scale-out index. Instead you map a
   procedure against the index and it is executed locally on each
   index partition within some key-range.

------------------------------------------------------------
HBase

UTD has developed a prototype integration using HBase to support RDF.
There are similar efforts underway elsewhere, but no results have been
reported for any implementation.  The UTD integration defines a single
HTable with three column families.  Each column family corresponds to
one of the spo, pos, osp orderings.  So in principle they have an
"index" per column family.  

- The joins will be done in ram on the client with triples flooding
  back from all nodes in the cluster having data for a given triple
  pattern.  That was the main problem with Sesame 1.x -- in memory
  joins.  Bigdata distributes the join processing.

- They are not normalizing the RDF Values (URIs, literals, etc).  This
  stuff is all stored as string values in hbase.  Even the blank nodes
  (based on their ID, which has broken semantics).  This means that
  the indices will be fatter.  It also means that there will be more
  network IO to transfer those strings around and that joins have to
  compare strings rather than long integers.  Unless HBase is unicode
  clean, this could also cause problems with efficient triple pattern
  visitation. this The only upsides to this approach are that they do
  not need to resolve the race condition on the Value -> Id mapping
  (we handle this specially) and that they do not need to join against
  the Id -> Value index before rendering the results as RDF/XML.
  However, it is going to be a big penalty on the index size, network
  IO and join performance.

- As far as I can tell they have no way to order the joins for
  efficient processing.  This is HUGE penalty.  The wrong join order
  can be orders of magnitude slower.  Different RDF DBs address this
  problem differently.  We have fast key range counts using just two
  B+Tree probes.  YARs pre-compiled this information in a post-load
  operation.

Recommendations:

	- head to head tests of bigdata, hbase, cassandra, etc.,
          etc. to gain insight on the underlying performance and
          scalability of these platforms.

	- head to head tests of bigdata/rdf and utd/rdf-hbase
          integrations to gain insight into their performance on data
          load and query.

------------------------------------------------------------
PRIORITIES

	- Quads and Sesame test suites for same.

	  - run the basic test suite for quads.

	    - use base IRI as the context during load.

	    - cross-validation of indices.

	  - @todo delete [bigdata-trunk].  rename
            [bigdata-trunk-no-branch] as [bigdata-trunk].

	  - done. quad store unit tests and test suite refactor so we
            can run just the store level and not the inference level
            tests. [*** run the quad store tests.]

	  - done. turn off performance counter collection for all
            local / embedded federation unit tests.

 	  - (****) unit tests are not cleaning up correctly.  rename
            closeAndDelete() as tearDownUnitTest() and cleanup close()
            and destory() implementations.

		- (***) use __teatDownUnitTest() to keep down the
                  temporary stores that are not being deleted.

		- done. embedded federation appears to be creating a
                  one-up federation name and a distinct instance on
                  restart.  it is supported to be creating an instance
                  named for the unit test.

		   - done. The EDS problem with restart is linked to
                     the global LRU.  I am not seeing the cache
                     cleared for the LBS's journal backing the events
                     history.

		   - done. set the LBS logDir to "lbs"

	  - The services need IService#destroy() throws
	    RemoteException.  All service impls and federations need
	    to provide this. TempStoreFactory for Journal and
	    AbstractFederation needs to implement closeAll() and be
	    invoked from those contexts to close out temporary stores
	    for which we still have hard references.

	  - AbstractServer must keep reference to service and then
	    issue destroy against the service to delete the persistent
	    resources and finally destroy the service directory.

	  - (***) LDS: The "JUST" index needs to be declared for LDS
            rule execution.  It was getting a free ride for LDS from
            AbstractRelation#getIndexNames().  That no longer returns
            the name of the "JUST" index.  Review and fix.

	  - QUADS : bigdata and Sesame TCK test suites.

	  - 

	- The whitepaper must be finished now.

	- Support glitter integration, performance optimizations
          against sample data sets, and hot backup for the Journal.

	- Errors introduced into the federation test suites by the LRU
          nexus and test suite clean up issues for the same.

	- Retest on the cluster.

	- Continued large data set load testing.

	- Tx with reconcile of RDF writes.

	  - Fast computation of delta between commit points.

	  - Fast notification mechanism of delta in each tx.

	- Record compression will change the performance for the
          simple value raba, will change the binary format of the
          record (a header coding the compression scheme and header
          length), and will change the serialization for
          IndexMetadata.  This needs to happen SOON.

	  ------------------------------------------------------------

Cluster setup

	- done [I think; used setup action] install JDK1.6.0_16 on all
          hosts.
	
	- use compressed pointers on WinXP64?  try 32-bit dpp server.

	- setup profiler in the environment and monitor from localhost
          or blade2.

	- Run single server U8000.  Try on 32-bit server also, but be
          prepared that it may require a 64-bit server.  Why?  We used
          to run 1B on a 32-bit server without a problem.

	- try U8000 on cluster (looks Ok, but peaking ~275k tps rather
          than ~300k tps), do some performance tuning (LRUNexus, m,
          writeQ; also seg.m (was 64 in the bigdataCluster16 file but
          256 in the bigdataCluster file) for load and query).  Look
          at LRU cache, RAM and GC statistics over time [drop
          seg.bytesOnDisk]. G1?

	  retry @ 6:30. if works, the LBS bias (start/round robin)
	  problem is severe.

	  throughput drops through the floor after 10 minutes.  why?
	  Is this GC?  Move of POS; bad start; start after LBS initial
	  round robin period?  hot spot on blades 3 and 13?

	- try large pre-generated data set (U100000 failed during
          generation, so try U50000 or just load anyway).

	- There are a lot of duplicate strings in the LBS.  They come
          from the incoming events.  There is no normalization for
          those de-serialized values.  Things like "summary", the
          names of the indices, the DataService paths, etc. occur 10k+
          times.

  There are 15 instances of com.bigdata.jini.start.IServicesManagerService on 15 hosts
  There are 1 instances of com.bigdata.journal.ITransactionService on 1 hosts
  There are 8 instances of com.bigdata.service.IClientService on 4 hosts
  There are 20 instances of com.bigdata.service.IDataService on 10 hosts

Commit message: Merging trunk into branch BTREE_BUFFER_BRANCH [2004]:[2048].

Goals:

------------------------------------------------------------

     FIXME Retest on cluster now that the LRU is no longer causing us
     to run out of memory.  Try a higher BTree branching factor for a
     faster journal.  Explore more LRU buffering (maxPercent).

     FIXME TestAsynchronousStatementBuffer is broken (the problem is
     actually with the global LRU not being cleaned on an abort and/or
     the test case reusing the same store).

          The problem is inconsistent results even on a triple store
	  when we compare the indices!!!!

     FIXME LDS test suite failures, at least for the RDF store and
	   perhaps for the core modules as well.  Check EDF also.
	   Problems are the events file and the LRUNexus.  Perhaps
	   disable the events journal for the unit tests?

	   Federations (LDS/EDF?) are are not cleaning up after
	   themselves in the unit tests, at least on test failures.

	   Ah.  Also disable typeperf on Windows for unit
	   tests. Basically, do not collect OS counters in the unit
	   tests.  I have 400 typeperf processes running and can not
	   do anything else.

     FIXME Embedded federation crashes on
           TestRestartSafe.test_restartSafe and thereafter throws
           java.nio.channels.OverlappingFileLockException.  I already
           modified the test harness to destroy the LRUNexus.  I need
           to look into this!!!

Quads:

- Revisions:

  - Starting revision is 2078 on the B+Tree refactor branch.

  - Revision 2079 adds support for compressed (.gz,.zip) files to the
    DataLoader.  I am using that to test on U8000 on machines that do
    not otherwise have enough disk for the SOURCE data.

  -------------------- quads trouble spots --------------------

   - Note: I changed the provenance mode default to [false].  People
     should explicitly enable this if they want to be provenance
     aware.  We should consider renaming the mode to "PROVENANCE"
     while we are doing this and update the wiki.

   - Review all explicit use of SPOKeyOrder.SPO (92), POS (39), or
     OSP(31).  These uses are probably wrong.

   - ISPO:isFullyBound() and SPOPredicate:isFullyBound() MIGHT need to
     be database mode aware.  Review all uses of these methods.

   - SPOPredicate#arity() depends on whether or not [c] is bound!
     SPOPredicate#get() was throwing an exception if [c] was null
     rather than returning null.  How does this effect everything?

   - SPO#compare(), SPO#equals() and SPO#hashCode() : These methods
     implement the Sesame definitions which only consider the (s,p,o).
     SPO#equals() does also consider the statement type (explicit,
     inferred, axiom).

   - inference is not quad aware.

     - backchainers / expanders are not quad aware.

     - BaseAxioms : SPO or SPOC?  

     - Justification#VisitedSPOSet : Cross graph TM will probably
       never be supported so this can use an SPO index.

     - The Justification index itself must be (s,p,o,c) if we are
       going to store proof chains for named graphs and not allow
       interactions among those proof chains.

x. TM Bug.

	- (***) TM Bug: KB will not downgrade a statement from Explicit to Inferred. 

	  The KB will not downgrade a statement from Explicit to
	  Inferred if you retract the statement but it is still
	  supported.  I noticed this when I saw
	  StatementEnum#isOverride() which appeared to be doing an
	  incorrect bit test (==1 vs !=0).  I've added a unit test to
	  TestTruthMaintenance for this,
	  test_downgradeExplicitToInference().  It fails.

	  TruthMaintenance#retractAll() is using a downgrade buffer
	  with a DoNotAddFilter.  That filters out inferences, so when
	  we try to add the SPO to the downgradeBuffer, it was not
	  making it in.  Next I tried modifying the DoNotAddFilter to
	  let in any SPO with the 'override' flag set.  That seemed a
	  bit dangerous, so instead I modified the downgradeBuffer to
	  NOT use any filter.  Safer, I think.  However, still no
	  dice.

	  I *think* that the downgradeBuffer should be adding an
	  "Inferred, override" SPO to the focusStore.  Eventually,
	  that "override" SPO needs to be written onto the DB, where
	  it is responsible for changing the SPO state from Explicit
	  to Inferred -- and that is what is not happening.

	  (***) Verify that asserting an explicit statement over an
	  inferred statement will cause the SID to be assigned and
	  then test downgrade also.
	  
	    - Should downgrade on retraction of the explicit statement
	      to an inferred statement removes the SID from the
	      inferred statement (probably not - that sounds like it
	      would be a concurrency issue for scale-out).

x. Transient B+Tree issues.

        - Add flag to transient B+Tree to NOT code records for the
	  fastest possible access.  This could be used for the axioms
	  or any other really hot code.

	- (*) Verify that transient B+Trees convert data records to
          immutable data records when there is an eviction event.
          This will help us bound their in-memory footprint.

	  Need a unit test for this.

	- Historically, a mutable node was always non-persistent. With
          the introduction of coding of nodes and leaves for transient
          B+Trees on eviction from the write retention queue, those
          nodes and leaves become read-only when they are coded
          without becoming persistent.  While {@link
          IAbstractNodeData#isCoded()} currently reflects the same
          distinction as {@link IAbstractNodeData#isReadOnly()}, that
          might not always be the case. For example, it is possible to
          have mutable coded node/leaf impls.

	 - (***) There really need to be more unit tests for transient
	   B+Trees to get at other broken assumptions, primarily
	   asserts which are no longer valid.

	 - (***) A weird problem shows up for transient B+Trees during
           remove.  The problem is during removeAll().  One of the
           siblings for a merge has a deleted parent, so they are not
           in fact siblings of the same parent node!

	   This looks like a real bug.  It might be connected to the
           transient B+Tree semantics, but we should never have a
           child which does not point back to its parent!

	   One possibility is that the update of the parent on the
	   children during merge() is broken, e.g., it does not update
	   the last child's parent for some code path.
	   Node#redistributeKeys() also does this.  The copyOnWrite
	   Node() ctor is another place where we do this.  And
	   copyOnWrite() also invokes replaceChildRef(), which is
	   another place where the parent is changed.

	   split() also updates the child references, but it is less
	   likely to be the cause of a deleted parent.

	   There are unit tests for these things, but perhaps they are
	   not verifying that the parents are updated correctly?

	   Why does TestRemoveAll() not trigger this?

	   Check TestSplitJoinThreeLevels.  It it is not testing the
	   parent reference assumptions then perhaps the problem
	   exists even in a simple and well documented unit test.

	   (***) Add asserts in the top-down navigation, split, join,
	   and copyOnWrite to verify that the parent of a node is
	   never deleted.

           (***) I have a handle on this now. Both child.identity and
           triggeredByChildId will always be 0L for a transient B+Tree
           since we never assign persistent identity to the nodes and
           leaves. Therefore [child.identity != triggeredByChildId]
           will fail for ALL children, including the trigger, and
           therefore fail to set the parent on any of them. The
           [btree.store==null] test handles this condition and always
           steals the child, setting its parent to this new node.  It
           is clear that testing on child.identity is broken in some
           other places for the transient store.  (***) Survey all
           tests on PO.identity and identify other places where any
           of the following assumptions enter in:

	     - [child.identity == triggeredByChildId]

	     - [child.identity != triggeredByChildId] (Node's copy ctor)

	     - node.isReadOnly() --> persistent (transient nodes are
               converted to coded nodes, but they are not made
               persistent when they are converted.

	       In fact, disabling that conversion would fix the
               transient delete unit test and provides a workaround
               for this bug!  This is trivially done in the
               DefaultEvictionListener

            if (node.dirty && btree.store != null) {

	       // btree.writeNodeOrLeaf(...)

	    }

	   The following assumptions are still valid (right?):

	     - [child.identity == 0L] still implies dirty. (transient
               nodes are never assigned a persistent address).

x. Other unit test problems:

         - (*) TestIsolatedFusedView - Add a unit test here with
	   cursor#remove(), then fix remove() to propagate the tuple
	   revision timestamp with the delete marker.

	 - (*) TestTx - test itr#remove() for tx isolation.

	 - (*) Suggests memory leak in the unit tests.  E.g., store
           file not closed, services not shutdown, leak of the direct
           buffers, etc.

	   (***) This appears to be a memory leak through AcceptTask
	   in NonBlockingLockManagerWithNewDesign with the stack local
	   variable acting as a GC root.  Perhaps making AcceptClass
	   static would get rid of this problem?

	 - The RDF jini federation tests are all failing due to
           configuration file errors (files not found, etc).

	 - Lots of unit tests are still leaking files on the disk.

6. (***) Tighter coding & versioning.

   - Make sure all records and Externalizable interfaces are versioned.
       
   - The NodeSerializer or the NodeCoder and LeafCoder SHOULD be
     configuration parameters so we can evolve the node/leaf data
     record at will.  There are still a lot of performance benefits to
     be had from tweaks in this area.

   - Compare the size on disk of the trunk and this branch.
  
  	 - Code the version timestamp[].

	   - done. A good coding scheme might be the minimum timestamp
             plus a minimum width coding for the remainder for each
             timestamp.

	   - Encapsulate the {min,max,t[]} for version timestamps and
             their coders.

	   - Share pluggable timestamp serialization logic for
	     DefaultLeafCoder and ResultSet.  Note that version
	     information is always delivered IF it is being
	     maintained.

	 - Code the childAddr[].

	   A good scheme might be identical to the version timestamp
	   scheme since the childAddr[] will tend to have a shared
	   prefix (actually, they might not since they are broken down
	   internally into a byte offset and a byte length).

	   For an index segment, the childAddr[] values will also be
	   strictly increasing (again, not true since they code the
	   region, the byte offset, and the byte length).

	   Note: IAddressSerializer must be provisioned with
	   information about the IAddressManager if it will use
	   address aware coding.  That information is not currently
	   available to the INodeCoder.
	     
        - Code the childEntryCount[].

	  A similar scheme might apply here.  Since the B+Tree is
	  balanced the #of spanned tuples for each child will be
	  roughly comparable, hence substracting out the minimum could
	  save space.

	- TERM2ID could use direct addressing of the assigned term
          identifiers if they are not packed.  That could well save
          space over their huffman coding or simple coding since we
          just store the long[].
	  
	- Compare simple vs huffman coding of ID2TERM at m<33 (e.g.,
          on the journal).

	- global prefix for front-coded raba?  most nodes and leaves
          will have a non-zero prefix shared by their keys.  we could
          save time and space if that prefix was factored out either
          by the front-coded byte[] list or by the front-coded raba.

	- keys front coded canonical huffman raba?  The canonical
	  huffman raba coder does not factor out the common prefix, if
	  any, for the raba.  That would be useful for a keys raba
	  since a common prefix is ... common and that would reduce
	  the storage requirements and increase search speed.  In
	  fact, we could do a front-coded huffman coded approach for
	  keys.

        - IndexMetadata.

          - Review all of the options relating to object
            serialization, key/value compression, and record
            compression.

	    Note that record level compression might be moved into the
	    store.  It is covered right now by the NodeSerializer.
	    That has the advantage of being per B+Tree, even on the
	    journal and of not challenging any existing APIs. It has
	    the disadvantage of making the NodeSerializer complex.

	  - Add options for the LeafCoder and NodeCoder?

x. (***) RMI SHOULD reuse buffers whenever possible.

	 - Index write pipeline.  This is easier to do for things like
	   the index write pipeline.

         - ResultSet. It is not clear how to do this for the
	   Externalizable interface used by the ResultSet.  Probably
	   we need to have a ResultSetCoder so we can pass in the
	   buffer.  Then the Externalizable implementation just
	   invokes the coder.

	 - Index procedure invocations.  Re-review use of IRabaCoding
	   for IIndexProcedure impls.  Can we use a "Coder" model here
	   as well and only code if we will do an RMI?  Also review
	   the KVO(C)[] model and compare with the IRaba model.
	   
         - Unit tests for serialization of index procedure abstract
	   classes, and the means they have of passing back byte[][]s
	   and bit[]s.

	 - There are no unit tests for serialization coverage for
           IndexMetadata.

	 - Unit tests of serialization for the IRabaCoders.

	 - Review use of rabas in index procedures with an eye to
           minimizing allocation.  Avoid double-coding if the
           keys/values are already coded.  Reconcile with KVO(C)[]
           usage.  This should NOT effect the IIndexProcedure
           serialization since we already use ICodedRaba's for RMI.
   
	 - getKeys():IRaba and getValues():IRaba SHOULD be raised into
	   the IKeyArrayIndexProcedure API.  This will make it easier
	   to use efficient access to the coded data.

7. (***) Buffering & caching.

   - scanHead on the global LRU may be doing too much.  It is 1% of
     all time.


	  -------------------- IndexSegment(Builder) --------------------

	- We do not always need to buffer newly generated index
          segments since they are sometimes moved rather than used
          locally.  The use of the write through cache by the
          IndexSegmentBuilder should therefore be an option controlled
          by the caller.

	- The write through cache must also be aware of IUpdateStore,
          which is used by the IndexSegmentBuilder.  

	- The IndexSegment has a weak value leaf cache with lookup by
          the addr of the leaf.  The backing hard reference queue
          should be global.  The weak value leaf cache can be reused
          for all B+Tree implementations as the node/leaf cache.  Why
          do we try to avoid placing nodes into this cache?

        - Make sure that the IndexSegmentBuilder reuses buffers and
          slices in an optimal manner.  See flush() in that class.

	- Unit test for IndexSegment with version timestamps enabled
          which verifies the correct max/max version timestamps on the
          nodes and leaves.

        - Examine GC problems with lots of B+Tree nodes buffered.  Try
          parallel old GC and the G1 collector.

	  Tony Printezis [Antonios.Printezis@sun.com] 10G+ heaps will
	  most likely create unpleasant Full GC pauses!  :-) But, yes,
	  evaluate Parallel Old to first see how it works. And we can
	  take it from there...


Using a hash map with weak references pointing to the data, while
maintaining strong references to the data that they do not want to see
evicted, is a reasonable idea (and _much_ better than using soft
references to achieve the same result!!!). Things to watch out:

1) They said that they would start dropping strong references using an
   LRU policy once the heap occupancy gets under a certain
   threshold. They have to watch out here. What Java would report as
   used space will include the occupancy of the young generation. And
   because that seesaws, it might be that case that the used space
   will look to be over the threshold (as the eden is filling up), but
   it will then drop below the threshold a few secs later (after a
   young GC). Assuming that most cache entries will live long enough
   to make it to the old gen, a better way to do this is to actually
   monitor the old gen occupancy, it will be a more stable
   metric. Also, are they going to use ParallelGC or CMS? If they use
   the latter and the decide to drop the strong references after a CMS
   cycle has started, then those entries might not get dropped one
   time (they will be dropped during the next cycle).

2) Something else to watch out is that some entries might have already
   handed out to application threads that have requested them. So,
   even if they decide to remove some entries from the cache, some
   threads might still be holding on to them and, as a result, less
   memory than planned might be reclaimed during the GC. I don't know
   how much of a problem this would be in practice. I assume that they
   would use the weak reference callback facility to remove entries
   from the hash map.

3) Yes, managing native buffers using NIO is a pain. They don't really
   "leak", but they are not promptly reclaimed either. NIO buffers
   rely on finalization to reclaim their native resources (and for
   good, and surprising to me, reasons they cannot be explicitly
   disposed of). As a result, they can only be typically reclaimed
   during Full GCs. So, if the application uses them up at a higher
   rate than it fills up the old gen, it's likely to run out of native
   space before the next Full GC. Using Java objects is a better idea
   IMHO.

----

Ref (3), I asked about finalization and Tony replied:

----

You can call System.gc() and System.runFinalization() to force
unreachable objects to be finalized. Some customers do use that to
deal with the issue of NIO buffers running out. But System.gc() is
quite expensive as it's getting more expensive as heaps are growing
larger...

BTW, here's the reason why NIO buffers cannot be explicitly disposed
(unlike, say, Swing components). If you dispose of one that's still
reachable, then some thread might be still accessing its address space
after that buffer has been disposed of. If then another buffer is
allocated that reserves the same address space, then you now have a
security issue. So you have to ensure that no references exist to an
NIO buffer before it's been disposed of. The NIO folks were asking me
whether it would be easy to decide whether a particular object is live
or not to maybe be able to dispose of the buffers earlier... I said
that we can do that, but it will not be very useful as it will be a
whole heap operation (full marking basically...). You're better off
doing a Full GC and reclaim all buffers that are unreachable.


------------------------------------------------------------
-------------- Store level record compression --------------
------------------------------------------------------------

   - Compare size on disk again once record level compression is
     enabled.

   - Allow B+Tree specific record compression, store-based record
     compression, or both?  Conceptually nicer in the store itself.

   - Update IndexMetadata read-retention queue and write retention
     queue javadoc (remove options for the read-retention queue since
     it is going to be global).

IRawStore

    write(ByteBuffer data):long		// write compressed record on the disk.
    read(long addr):ByteBuffer		// read compressed record from the disk.
    delete(long addr):void		// not in the API at this time.

LRUNexus - global instance for coordinating LRU caches.

    // cache for data records, node/leaf data records, or deserialized objects
    getCache(IRawStore):Map<Long,Object>

ICompressedStore extends IRawStore

    // compress slice and write on backing store.
    write(byte[],off,len,headerLen,CompressorEnum):long -or-
    write(IByteArraySlice,headerLen:int,CompressionEnum):long

    // read a record from the store, obtaining the decompressed view
    // of the application record header and application record body.
    read(addr:long):IFixedDataRecord (in fact, FixedByteArrayBuffer)

    There is an API tension surrounding IUpdateStore.  That interface
    is motivated by the IndexSegmentBuilder which needs to have the
    addr from which the record can be recovered before it has written
    the record in order to set the prior/next addr fields.  The
    problem is that we need to know the actual bytes after compression
    in order to allocate the space efficiently for a WORM store.  This
    conflict could be resolved if we restrict the update to the header
    data.

    So

        update(long addr, int off, ByteBuffer data):void

    becomes

	update(long addr, int off, IByteArraySlice):void

    which only permits update to the header region. off+slice.len()
    must lie within the header region for this operation to be valid.

    In fact, IUpdateStore could just be rolled into ICompressedStore
    as some optional methods for operations on the header.  Look at
    the IndexSegmentBuilder for compatibility with this approach.

// Adds transparent caching of decompressed records.
ICachedStore extends ICompressedStore

    getLRUNexus():LRUNexus

    // initialized from the LRUNexus on (re-)open.
    private final ConcurrentWeakValueCache<Long,FixedDataRecord>

    // extended to write through on the cache.
    write(IByteArraySlice,headerLen:int,CompressionEnum):long

    // extended to test the cache first and place the record into the
    // cache on a miss.
    read(addr:long):IFixedDataRecord (in fact, FixedByteArrayBuffer)
    
	(De-)compression layer.

	   Transparently (de-)compresses records on their way into/out
	   of the IRawStore and adjusts the byte[] slice so as to show
	   only the application header bytes followed by the
	   application data bytes.

	   Decompression can be concurrent or single threaded
	   (configured thread pool size).  Decompression is relatively
	   fast, especially when compared to compression.

	   This MAY break code since byteCount(addr) != slice.len()
	   when record level compression is enabled.

	   Record level compression can be configured at least at the
	   store level with the index segment compression provider
	   configured by the IndexMetadata.  Potentially allow a BTree
	   compression provider override of the default journal
	   compression provider.

	   IndexSegmentStore must do something special here in how it
	   buffers the nodes region of the file.

    - Direct ByteBuffers are only really useful when reading from or
      writing on the disk.  In that context they can minimize the IO
      cost.  However, they place the data outside of the JVM heap and
      make it difficult to operate efficiently on byte[]s.

      The (de)compression API is a natural place to convert from
      direct ByteBuffers to <byte[],off,len> slices.  It may be that
      this should happen inside of the IRawStore or that the IRawStore
      should be extended by IRecordCache which adds an API for access
      to the cached byte[] slices.

      The DiskOnlyJournal also uses direct buffers in its write cache.
      In fact, it implements both a read cache and a write cache.  

    - Possible implementations for refactoring include:

	   DiskOnlyStrategy#writeCache:WriteCache

	   DiskOnlyStrategy#readCache:LRUCache<Long, byte[]>
	   
	   IndexSegmentStore#leafCache:ConcurrentWeakValueCacheWithTimeout<Long, ImmutableLeaf>

	   IndexSegmentStore:buf_nodes:ByteBuffer (nodes region buffer)

	   IRecordCompressor, IRecordCompressionFactory,
	   RecordCompressor (based on Deflate), NOPCompressor.

	   bmz

	   gzip
	   
	   zip

    - Remove ByteBuffer from the IRawStore API, replacing it with our
      byte[] slice class, e.g., com.bigdata.io.Slice.

- Support gzip, zip, bmz and other compression protocols in the store
  at the record level.

	 There is a open source implementation of bmdiff/zippy like
         library in Hypertable, called bmz. It’s written in pure ANSI
         C, and can be easily embedded in any project (that was a goal
         I had in mind, so it’s written in C instead of C++ like the
         rest of the Hypertable). The performance is similar to
         google’s published numbers for small blocks (the size of
         sstable block from 64KB-128KB. The speed to will go down
         dramatically (to about 40MB/s), when the block size is big
         enough to thrash the processor cache, as the algorithm uses a
         hashtable.)  I wrote it (the bmdiff part, lzo is used for the
         optional final pass) mostly for experiments without much
         optimization (so there are rooms for improvement). The
         Rabin-Karp like hash functions can be easily plugged in for
         experiments. Feel free to give it try and ping me on how to
         use the library (documentation is in bmz.h.)

	- The IRawStore API SHOULD NOT make the ByteBuffer's read-only
          and would be better off if it used an IRawRecord/Slice
          combination.

        - Decompress should be byte[] to byte[] using streams ala
	  DataInputBuffer and DataOutputBuffer.

	  If a "compression service" is added, make sure that it can
	  not cause deadlocks.
             
        - Optimize out the use of the ByteBuffer.  This should be easy
          to hack w/ record level compression if we use a
          ByteArrayBuffer as the (de-)compression target.

        - Record level compression for the store.

	- The IndexSegment nodes region can be read into a byte[]
          rather than a direct ByteBuffer.  I do not believe that we
          gain access to any additional memory with direct ByteBuffers
          and they are definately slower and consume memory which can
          not be otherwise reused.  This will make it possible to do
          perfect allocations for the nodes region.
	  
	  The nodes region could be compressed as a single record if
          we get tricky.  That would be better compression, but all
          addressing into the nodes region would have to be in terms
          of the decompressed record.  You could not directly read on
          the file system at the given byte address since it would be
          in the middle of a compressed region.


    1. Record compression (e.g., deflate)

       Store as record header + compressed (deflate) record body.

       Using deflate (record level compression) is new.  The thing
       which makes it difficult is the double-linked leaves in the
       index segment.  The record size must be known when we obtain
       the address of the record from the store.  This means that the
       priorAddr/nextAddr are outside of the compressed region.  Thus
       generalized record compression at the store level requires us
       to mark the #of header bytes.  Otherwise we can handle record
       compression at the B+Tree level.

    2.

     Header:

	  -- header --
	  headerDataLength(byte) // node=1;leaf=1;linkedLeaf=17(1+sizeof(long)*2)) 
	  [ // This field exists iff compression was used.
	   bodyDataLength(int)
	  ]

       The [headerDataLength] gives the #of bytes of application data
       in the header exclusive of the header metadata. If there is no
       application header data then this field is zero.  The header
       data is intended to represent data which can not be compressed.
       For example, the priorAddr and nextAddr fields of an
       IndexSegment leaf can not be compressed because we need to know
       the total size of the record before they can be assigned. If
       the byte count is negative, then it is interpreted as the #of
       32-bit words containing (uncompressed) header data.

       Option to exclude a record from compression?  Bit flag for that
       in the header, leaving 7 bytes for the header data length?
       Writes would have to go around the compression API to avoid
       compress or would have to specify the compression provider (NOP
       vs)....  Could also use byte to indicate the compression
       provider, with 0 reserved for NOP, 1 for Deflate, 2 for Zip, 3
       for GZip, 4 for bmz.  Lot's of room for extension there, but
       the extensions must be compiled into the codebase.

       Either all records in the store are compressed by a common
       technique or none are.  This is indicated when the store is
       created.  The compression method should be something fast for
       the journal when used to absorb writes for a data service and
       could even be "none".  The compression method can also be set
       for each index and will be applied to all IndexSegmentStore
       files generated for that scale-out index.

       When the records for a store are compressed, [bodyDataLength]
       gives the #of bytes in the decompressed record body and is used
       to pre-allocate a right sized ByteBuffer when compressing the
       record.  The actual size of that ByteBuffer is the decoded
       headerDataLength plus the bodyDataLength.

       IRawStore#write(ByteBuffer) always writes a record with zero
       header data bytes.  IRawStore#write(int,ByteBuffer) writes a
       record whose first N bytes are stored in the header data
       section (outside of the compressed record body).  On read,
       the returned ByteBuffer always has exactly the same data.

       There will need to be alternative IRawStore#write() methods
       which accept the #of header data bytes.  The header data itself
       appears in the ByteBuffer to be written just as it would appear
       when the record was deserialized.  Compression may be applied
       to all records on the store.  The root blocks are fixed length
       regions which lie outside of the user space for the store and
       are not compressed. 

       Compression and decompression will need to pay attention to the
       header.  When we ready from the backing file we will get a
       ByteBuffer.  If the record in that ByteBuffer is compressed,
       then we automatically decompress the record.  The origin of the
       ByteBuffer is automatically adjusted to the start of the header
       data area.  The body data bytes follow the header data bytes so
       the ByteBuffer provides an uninterrupted view of the header
       data + body data to the application.

	    @todo Write a compression service.  It can have a queue
		  and use a small thread pool to (de-)compress
		  records.  Each worker thread will have its own
		  compression buffer, which should grow until "right
		  sized".

            FIXME review the use of byteCount as decoded from the addr
            in application level data structures.  If we allow
            optional compression then this will break code which
            assumes that the byteCount reflects the pre-compression
            record size. 
	    
	    @todo The IndexSegmentBuilder will have to explicitly
	          apply the selected record compression and we will
	          then have to patch the priorAddr and nextAddr on the
	          record.

       Checksums are a store-level option.  The checksum is computed
       for the entire record, including the record header and any
       application data stored in the header data bytes.  If both
       compression and checksums are enabled, then the checksum is
       taken of the compressed record.  When enabled, the checksum is
       written into the last 4 bytes of the record, and the size of
       the record is automatically adjusted to store those additional
       bytes.  The checksum itself is be visible at the {@link
       IRawStore} API layer (the ByteBuffer view is adjusted so as to
       hide the checksum).

	    @todo Write a checksum service.  It can have a queue and
		  use a small thread pool to compute or verify
		  checksums for records.  Notification should be
		  synchronous to avoid use of records whose checksums
		  indicate a media error.  This could be layered over
		  the compression service or the same worker thread
		  could be assigned both tasks.  Each worker thread
		  should have a thread local
		  com.bigdata.util.ChecksumUtility instance.

	    @todo The key and value compression APIs may need to be
		  changed since they were written with the assumption
		  that we were encoding onto an OutputStream.  

		  Can we apply record level compression to keys and
		  values serialized for RMI?

		  Can we serialize key/value data as ByteBuffer's
		  wrapped as INodeData for RMI?

	    @todo Move various interfaces and tests related to the
	          node and leaf data records into their own package.

       Node:

	  -- header data --
          type(byte) // 0=node
	  -- body (compressed) --
	  version(short)
	  ...

       Leaf:

	  -- header data --
          type(byte) // 1=leaf; 2=linkedLeaf
	  [ // iff linked leaf.
	   priorAddr(long)
	   nextAddr(long)
	  ]
	  -- body (compressed) --
	  version(short)
	  ...

       These record layouts order the fixed length fields and arrays
       with known dimensions to the front of the record.  The keys and
       values are ordered to the back of the record.

       The node/leaf type byte is in the header because we must
       inspect it before we can interpret the bytes which could
       correspond to the priorAddr and nextAddr fields and those
       fields can not be compressed, which is why they are stored in
       the header data.  This means that the type field itself must be
       in the header data as well.  This means that writing a B+Tree
       node or leaf will always use IRawStore#write(int,ByteBuffer).

and query performance vs m=32.

New GC might do MUCH better - there are frequent major GC pauses.

       **** Cache dialog (move to the write retention queue).

	    The write retention queue keeps hard references around so
	    top-down navigation via weak references works for recently
	    touched nodes.  We constantly touch the queue to keep the
	    LRU current.

	    The global cache is a canonicalizing mapping from address
	    to the data record object.  It is only used for persistent
	    (and hence clean) nodes and leaves.

	    READ: We putIfAbsent the data record into the cache (the
	    global LRU is touched iff the cache was modified) when it
	    is read from the backing store (readNode). putIfAbsent()
	    is used in case there was a concurrent read of the node by
	    a different BTree instance.

	    WRITE: On EVICTION -or- CHECKPOINT of a dirty node, we
	    code the data record and put() it into the cache (the
	    global LRU is touched). put() is used because there should
	    not be an entry in the cache for that address (WORM
	    store).

	    On EVICTION of a clean node, we do nothing.  The node will
	    continue to age on the global LRU.

	    The transient B+Tree uses hard references.  We DO NOT need
	    to touch the write retention queue since weak references
	    are not used UNLESS we are planning to code nodes when
	    they are evicted from the write retention queue.  We DO
	    NOT touch the global cache since the nodes DO NOT have
	    persistent addresses (there is no backing store).

            @todo [much the same result is obtained using record level
            compression and simple raba coders]. Hot nodes (and hot
            leaves) could be coded in order to write them on the store
            but left in their mutable form (MutableNodeData and
            MutableLeafData). This would provide faster operations on
            those hot objects. "Hot" could be determined by the
            reference count on the Node/Leaf. Of course, that is zero
            when they are evicted, but it can be non-zero for nodes
            and leaves which are written out in response to a check
            point. NOTE: If mutable node or leaf data records are
            placed into the cache then they MUST be overriden to mark
            them as read-only sinces they will be shared by multiple
            B+Tree instances and MUST NOT be used for mutations!!!
        
     - Heap and GC costs.

       - copyOnWrite(). A lot of time and allocation costs are driven
         by copyOnWrite().  A larger write retention queue can reduce
         those costs.  This should be applied to specific B+Tree
         instances so we do not inflate the queue for Name2Addr and
         such.  A larger queue can also increase heap utilization and
         commit latency, so there are tradeoffs here.

	 copyOnWrite for SPO indices is now cheap.  Copy on write for
	 the ID2TERM and TERM2ID indices still shows up as a cost, but
	 it is way down.

         - Optimized values raba for Term2Id (long[]).

         - Test w/ simple vs huffman for Id2Term (BigdataValue has its
           own serialization format and includes plenty of Unicode
           data).

	   Compare performance against disk usage and consider in
	   tandom with record level compression, which could make the
	   simple raba coder much more appealing.

	   [If ASCII only for the index, then we could store the value
           as ASCII as well.  Normalization should occur during the
           parse I guess.]

	 - Raba backed by a single byte[] for encoding keys or values
           in a linear projection onto the backing byte[].  In
           combination with a modification of the ITupleSerializer API
           to return the KeyBuilder rather than the key (or the
           DataOutputBuffer), this could be used to avoid allocation
           of the 1000s of very small byte[]s involved in RMI
           operations on the statement indices.  This approach would
           not work for indices with variable length keys or values.
           The raba could be transmitted as its backing byte[],
           compressed in its Externalizable using some fast
           compression technique before transmission, or coded over to
           another raba impl for transmission.

       - LRUNexus: Better ergonomics: percentHeap = .3 can be too much
         memory on a machine with limited RAM loading a large data
         set.  Put a profiler on a RAM limited (1g) JVM on a large
         data set load (U50) and see where the memory is going and why
         it gets into high GC overhead. The issue is likely to be that
         the write retention queue (8000) is too large for the higher
         branching factor (64) with a larger data set on a machine
         with little memory. Also back down the branching factor to 32
         since the write retention queue will then reserve much less
         data. E.g., 100000k bytes for buffers, branchingFactor=32,
         writeRetentionQueue=500 would be a good profile for a 32-bit
         machine. Does this problem happen once the bloom filter gets
         shut off? [Maybe the coded records are actually taking more
         heap space? For some coders, e.g., huffman? Could code only
         for write and otherwise leave mutable as a low-memory
         option?]  Try favoring less heap space, smaller write
         retention buffer, smaller global buffer, and doing more IO.
         The IO seems to be the easier cost to bear when compared with
         GC.

         - Try native long maps from fastutil and RT java maps.

       - writeQ : better ergonomics.  Auto-extend the write queue
         after some nubmer of touches from a default (500) to a big
         value (8000).  This will automatically and dynamically give
         us better performance for sustained data loads.  Just be sure
         not to do this if we are running out of available RAM or
         having a lot of GC activity.

       - Compression API
       
         - IRawStore makes ByteBuffers read-only.  This means that we
           will create an extra byte[] from each ByteBuffer in order
           to decode the record.

------------------------------------------------------------
Query performance tuning:

	    - Optimization could reuse a caller's SPOAccessPath
	      instance, setting only the changed data on the
	      fromKey/toKey.  That could be done with setS(long),
	      setO(long), setP(long) methods.  The filter could be
	      modified in the same manner.  That could cut down on
	      allocation costs, formatting the from/to keys, etc.

	    - (*) Reduce query latency

	      - Compare overhead for starting nexted subquery joins or
		pipeline joins.  Does one have higher overhead?  How
		can it be eliminated?

		The pipeline joins have more latency but are faster.
		They are significantly faster when the G1 collector is
		used.  Nexted subquery is faster when it uses limited
		parallelism for subquery evaluation.

              - Examine subtask setup costs for pipeline joins and
                look for better reuse of things such as the tail
                relation view.

	    - Try different ratio for front coding.  All cost appears
              in the binarySearch().  Play with the ratio until some
              cost is moved into search(), which includes the linear
              search.  Keep that ratio if the total cost is thereby
              decreased.  Within node/leaf key search is 16% of query.

	      A front-coded long[] could reduce the search time as
	      well since we would then be doing comparison on long
	      values.

	    - Factor out the BackingBufferArray abstraction from the
	      custom front coded raba implementation, but remember to
	      roll the offset into all addressing into the backing
	      byte[].

	    - WeakReference traversal for prior/next leaf and changing
              the eviction order could improve the standard case of a
              forward iterator scan.  The problem with this that we
              can not always lookup the next leaf by its address so we
              would have to re-locate the successor of the key if the
              weak reference was null or had been cleared.

	    - Look at GC costs and the allocation patterns which drive
              them.

	      Constant<Long> : Do a ConstantLong implementation that
	      avoids wrapping the long as a Long.  Make sure that
	      native long comparisons occur where ever possible or we
	      will be better off wrapping as a Long just once rather
	      than many times.

(****) m=64 may be better for the index segments as well.  Test this
       out. 

(****) try out m=64 on U8000 and U50000 on a single server.  Where are
       the limits? how is the performance?

New options:

    Note: If the JVM heap is too large, then it can create HUGE pause
    times if the JVM needs to read parts of the heap which have been
    swapped out.  This does not always show up as swapping.  For
    example, on a Windows XP Professional x64 machine it shows up as a
    sustained low CPU usage correlated to a sustained high average
    disk queue length, but not as page/sec.  No clue why.  That
    machine had 8G of RAM, but even with the machine configured to
    given priority to programs for scheduling and memory, it could not
    use more than a 4G JVM heap without running into trouble.  Ah! It
    appears that eclipse is swapping, perhaps due to its console
    output log.  I am going to rerun from the command line w/o
    eclipse.

    Also of interest, the 100% CPU utilization peaks on all cores are
    the ParallelOldGen GC running.

    -XX:+UseCompressedOops (64-bit only)

    Lower throughput, but shorter pauses.  Note that parallel young GC
    (the default for J6+) generally does better if there are GT 1-2
    processors.

	     - Sample Q9 and see where the effort is going and verify
               that everything is in cache after the first
               presentation of the query (NO reasds on the store or
               the disk).

  	         - deserializing the axioms into a new simple memory
                   store for each query?!?

	     - Factor out the abstract interface for the front-coded
               byte[] and use direct byte[] access throughout?  This
               will mean rolling the offset into the code.

               it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.bytes.CustomByteArrayFrontCodedList$BackingByteArray.get(int)

	 - (***) Load and most query is now slower(!?!) than for the
           trunk.

	   Consider decoding "hot" nodes and leaves.  E.g., if the ref
	   count is GT 10.  This would probably have to sync on the
	   node/leaf data record to avoid concurrent decoding and then
	   the new (decoded) data record would have to be placed into
	   the cache.  

	   We can monitor in the eviction listener and notice when the
	   ref count has dropped and consider reconversion to a coded
	   data record (either by keeping the persistent data record
	   and re-wrapping it or by re-reading it from the store), or
	   we could just leave it decoded until it is finally evicted
	   from the write retention queue and the global LRU.

	   Only Node/Leaf reference counts are maintained.  We do not
	   have reference counts for the data records at this time.
	   That could be done if we had them extend some base object
	   with the [ref] field.

	 - There are lots of other variables for query performance,
           such as the chunk capacity and the chunks of chunks
           capacity, but the difference between the branch and the
           trunk is the coding and buffering of B+Tree nodes and
           leaves.

	 - Doubling the writeRetentionQueue capacity has no impact on
	   query against historical data (LUBM U10).

	 - Effect of the writeRetentionQueue capacity for load.  The
           baseline is with a capacity of 500.

	   -------------
	   trunk: 19,218 (net 15,512)

	   look at store size.

	   look at performance on the trunk when writeRetentionQueue.capacity=8000

	   look at the max memory used and GC time and pauses.

	   is the test harness committing after each source file it
	   loads?  checkpointing the indices?

	   A B*Tree (split @ 2/3, join @ 1/3) could be substantially
	   faster since split/joins drive decoding to mutable parents.

	 - Correlate the maximumMemoryFootprint for bigdata against
           the retained heap and the size of the global LRU and the
           #of cached records across the stores.  Does this system as
           a whole respect the maximumMemoryFootprint?  Is it capped
           out on the global LRU?  Do the per-store caches retain more
           references than can be explained by the global LRU (plus
           the write retention queue, which is used even for read-only
           B+Tree instances).

         - Compare performance of the canonical huffman coder vs
           simple coder with and without record level compression.  It
           might be much faster to operate with record level
           compression over simple raba coding, though the in-memory
           footprint would be larger.

	 - The global LRU capacity is a huge performance variable.
           Correlate to the JVM size.

	 - The branching factor is also a huge performance variable.

	   Note: branchingFactor interacts with the effective buffer
	   size unless we change the assumed average record size.  If
	   fact, if we do not change the assumed average record size
	   then the performance rocks @ m=256 until we run into a low
	   memory situation and major GC costs begin to dominate.

	   Note: branchingFactor interacts with the store size due to
	   the WORM architecture.

	   Note: branchingFactor will interact with at least the cold
	   query latency since we materalize records of different
	   size, but query should be much better now since we are not
	   deserializing anything - just wrapping the coded record for
	   access by the node or leaf.

	   - Look at branching factor x store size x query time, but
             first optimize the copyOnWrite code paths.

           - Look at branching factor x statement buffer capacity
             (only the very large files can exploit a larger statement
             buffer).

	   - Look at branching factor on the index segments.

	 - Look at GC time x maximum heap x global LRU capacity.

	 - Try the new GC (incremental collection of the old gen).

	 - Try nscan := 0,5,10,20 for the global LRU.  We already trim
           duplicates using the write retention queue.  The global LRU
           can still see duplicates from concurrent access to the same
           B+Tree.

	 - (**) Reversing the dirty post-order iterator for eviction
           and saving the nextAddr on the leaves and maintaining their
           weak reference on the Leaf could improve performance in
           query since ChildIterator#next() drives a lot of the disk
           reads.  This would be a whole new code path for the BTree
           for linked forward scan iterators which avoided top-down
           reads whenever possible.

	 - (***) Do a performance test for TM and put a profiler on
           it.

	 - (***) Do a performance test for datalog query rewrites and
           put a profiler on it.

	 --------------------

	- Look at thread contention (none that I can see).

	- Is there a faster way to read/write a code word (only
          effects the ID2TERM index)?

	- Performance comparisons of different coders (primarily
          simple vs huffman) for the RDF DB (impacts TERM2ID, ID2TERM
          and statement indices when using SIDS).

	- Add OBS(byte[],off,len) ctor for faster operations on
          slices.

	- Try changing the front-coded raba ratio (normally 8, but try
          16 or m/4 which is 8 when m=32 but higher when m=64).  Note
          that leaves may be 1/2 full on average so, maybe m/2.

	- Try larger branching factors for the mutable BTree.  This
          might improve performance.  There may be interactions with
          the chunk size of the writes, the resulting size of the
          store on disk, and the size of the write retention queue.
          For example, buffing 1M SPOs might do much better than
          buffering 100k SPOs before an incremental write.

	- Try increasing the default write retention queue capacity
          and see how that effects throughput.

	- Faster and direct initialization of the
          CanonicalHuffmanRabaCoder#CodedRaba instance during
          encodeLive().  Directly set the various instance fields.

 	- Try using getValueStream() rather than getValue() and
          getKeyStream() rather than getKey() for ITuple operations.
          However, note that direct byte[] operations are often
          significantly faster unless the heap overhead becomes a
          bottleneck.

	- The front-coded raba could be more efficient (the backing
          implementation recomputes the length of the front coded
          array during extraction).

	- Try buffering more data when loading a series of documents.
          Do we get better B+Tree performance?

	- Performance comparisons of load rate change due to the
          coding of nodes and leaves when they are evicted and their
          subsequent use as coded data records.

	- AbstractRabaCoderTestCase#main(String[])

	     - There are definately optimizations which could be made
	       in the front-coded byte[], mainly dealing with
	       recomputing the length of a byte[] entry, but also with
	       copying the data efficiently onto an OutputStream.

	- Memory analyzer.  How is the in-memory representation now as
          compared to the trunk?

        - The default node and leaf keys coder should use
          front-coding.  However, there is a ratio parameter. The
          right value for the ratio could depend on the B+Tree
          branching factor, and that can vary for the mutable BTree
          and the IndexSegment.

       - RDF Front Coding or Canonical Huffman Leaf Key Coders.

         This would apply only to the leaves, where we always have
         full length keys.  Either front-coding or canonical huffman
         coding would work as long as they operating on long[] rather
         than byte[].

         - Front-coding should already be pretty efficient in space
           and time and we can always use the byte[] based huffman
           coder for RDF keys.

         - Generalize the CanonicalHuffmanRabaCoder to allow for
           non-byte values (char[], int[], long[]).  This should be
           very compact when the alphabet corresponds to the natural
           data type size.  E.g., RDF long[3] or long[4] keys.

         - What should be used for the default value coder?

	    - SimpleValueCoder (no compression)?

	    - CanonicalHuffmanValueCoder?

	    - ConditionalValueCoder wrapping SimpleValueCoder and
	      CanonicalHuffmanValueCoder with bigSize==33?
	      
	    See Id2TermTupleSerializer, which already uses the
	    ConditionalValueCoder.  Review the choice based on
	    performance for load, query, and size on disk.

	    TERM2ID should use a fixed size value coding for the
	    long[] of term identifers.  This _might_ save space and
	    will definately improve performance over huffman with
	    offset addressing.
	    
	    Note that huffman coding may cost more, but it may be
	    worth it for large data sets based on the in-memory
	    footprint.

	    It would be good to have a faster compression technique
	    for values as well.

	  - Consider authorative references for coders which are used
            in more than one location.  E.g., the leaf keys coder is
            used by the DefaultLeafCoder, but it is also used by the
            ITupleSerializer. What setting is authoratitive?  Is the
            value stored more than once?

          - Declarative override of the tuple serializer, the node and
            leaf keys coder, and the leaf vales coder in IndexMetadata
            as part of the DDL refactor.

       - Reduce byte[] allocation.
       
	   - Variant of B+Tree insert(), lookup(), contains(),
             remove() which accepts an input tuple.

	     This will let us avoid allocation of the key[] and/or
             value[] by the caller since they can use reuse a Tuple
             and copy the data into its internal buffers.  However,
             for insert() we will wind up allocating the byte[] for
             the value internally when it is written into the
             MutableValueBuffer and the key byte[] if unless there is
             an existing tuple for that key.

       - ByteBuffer is too slow.
	   
	     There are two very frequent batch operations which we use
	     where we are forced to use byte-at-a-time processing with
	     ByteBuffer.  These are (1) compareBytes(), which is an
	     unsigned byte[] compare; and (2) writeOn(OS), which is
	     used to copy byte[]s out of a raba.

	     DO NOT use ByteBuffer#asReadOnlyBuffer() since it hides
	     the backing byte[].

	     DO tunnel through to the backing {byte[], off, len} for a
	     heap ByteBuffer and use that data in place of the
	     ByteBuffer within IRabaCoder#decode()
	     implementations. Possibly extend the BackingBuffer
	     interface and implementations for this purpose.

	     Note: Test suites will have to exercise both with and w/o
	     the byte[] tunnel.  The easy way to do that is to use
	     ByteBuffer#asReadOnlyBuffer() since that will hide the
	     array().

	     Note: (*****) Methods which interact with a ByteBuffer
	     MUST NOT change its position or limit. If they do then
	     ALL methods which touch the buffer need to be
	     synchronized so NONE of them can have a concurrent read
	     during which the position/limit has been transiently
	     modified.  The culprits here are the bulk byte transfer
	     methods ByteBuffer#get() and ByteBuffer#put().  This is
	     really a huge limitation on the use of a ByteBuffer for
	     concurrent access to a read-only data structure!!!!

	     Note: We will still have a C heap ByteBuffer for the
             IndexSegment nodes region, but that might be the only
             place they show up.

	     Note: If we are doing record level compression then be
             sure to decompress to an expandable per-worker task
             byte[].  Once decompressed, create an exact fit byte[]
             and wrap it as a ByteBuffer.

	     Note: If the InputBitStream backed by a ByteBuffer is
	     buffered, then make sure that the buffer is a reasonable
	     size.  We could do this ourselves with a
	     BufferedInputStream wrapping the ByteBufferInputStream.

	     This could be part of how we reconcile the DataSerializer
	     and the IRabaCoder APIs.

------------------------------------------------------------
x. Packaging (ant script, dependencies).

       - Done. Converge on the standard fastutil and dsi dependencies,
         removing their variants from the lgpl-utils module and move
         the lgpl-utils module into the bigdata project.

	 - added dsiutils-1.0.10 (369k), replacing lgpl-utils.

	 - updated fastutils-5.1.4 to fastutils-5.1.5.

	 - colt-1.2.0 is unchanged.

	 - Package change for InputBitStream and OutputBitStream from
	   it.unimi.dsi.mg4j.io to it.unimi.dsi.io.

	 - Package change for Coder, Decoder, and HuffmanCodec from
           it.unimi.dsi.mg4j.compression to it.unimi.dsi.compression.

	 - Method change for Codec.getDecoder() to Codec.decoder().

	 - Method change for PrefixCodec.getCoder() to
           PrefixCodec.coder().

	 - (*) Verify use of the correct (new) ctor for
           OutputBitStream.

	   Verify new uses of FastByteArrayOutputStream in compression
	   code and of the OutputBitStream.  Make sure that we are not
	   allocating huge buffers when compared to the actual
	   requirements.

	 - (*) Verify requirement for additional dsiutil dependencies.

	 - Feedback to dsiutils on changes introduced in the
           CustomByteArrayFrontCodedList.  These changes are probably
           too far reaching to expect that they will make it back into
           dsiutils.

	 - (*) Replace it.unimi.dsi.mg4j.util.BloomFilter2 with
	   it.unimi.dsi.util.BloomFilter?

	   Request changes in dsi-utils so we can use that BloomFilter
	   class directly.

         - (*) Use autojar to extract only the necessary classes from
           fastutils.  Possibly do this as part of the lgpl-utils
           build.

	 - (***) Make sure that the ant script builds the lgpl-utils
           jar first and then links with it to reference the classes
           inside of that jar.  Work with the old lgpl-utils ant
           script which correctly propagated the binary files to
           support coding in the bit streams.

------------------------------------------------------------

x. Tuple revision filtering, per-child min/max tuple revision
   timestamp on Node, and overall min/max tuple revision timestamp on
   Node.

	 - The min/max tuple revision timestamps are not being
           maintained by Leaf.  Write unit tests for this.  

	   All of the mutation operations on the leaf need to track
	   the min/max version timestamp, including:

	   done. Leaf#insert() (as insert, update, or delete)

	   done. Leaf#remove() (if version timestamps are used w/o
		 delete markers)

	   Leaf#split() [Leaf is done, but Node.min[] and max[] are
	                 not done yet].
	   
	   Leaf#merge() [Leaf is done, but Node.min[] and max[] are
			 not updated yet.]
	   
	   Leaf#redistributeKeys() [Leaf is done, but Node.min[] and
				    max[] are not updated yet.]

	   ----

	   To track the min/max timestamp on the Node we must also
	   track the min/max timestamp for each direct child of that
	   node.  While this inflates the size of the Node's data
	   record considerably, we are required to track those
	   per-child data in order to avoid a scan of the children
	   when we need to recompute the min/max timestamp for the
	   Node.  The cost of that scan (with its IO) is simply not
	   acceptable.  The min/max timestamp on the Node is ONLY used
	   for filtering iterators based on a desired tuple revision
	   range.  This is why the choice to support tuple revision
	   filters is its own configuration option.

	   Node#insertChild()

	   Node#removeChild()

	   Node#split()

	   Node#merge()

	   Node#redistributeKeys()

	   merge/split appear to update the child entry counts on the
	   parent directly, so they must also update the min/max
	   directly.

	   Put the versionTimestamp[] into its own Class along with
	   the min/max version timestamps.  This will reduce the in
	   memory overhead for a MutableNodeData or MutableLeafData
	   instance which does not use version timestamps. This will
	   also make coding those data easier to isolate since there
	   can be an interface for the version timestamp information
	   (extended by IAbstractNodeData).

	   (****) Lots of tasty unit tests.  This really needs to be
	   tested in depth on the 3-level B+Tree example to ensure
	   that we are covering all of the bases, including
	   redistribution of keys, splitting of nodes, and merging of
	   nodes.

	   Done. [min=MAX_LONG iff empty, max=MIN_LONG iff empty,
	   verify in unit tests, including initial state and end state
	   after all tuples are removed] Firm policy on the initial
	   value of the min/max version timestamp.

	 - Support iterator filtering by a tuple revision range.
           Write the unit tests for that.  Consider change the
           IRangeQuery API to have an object which declares the
           iterator parameters since there are SO MANY.  The iterator
           should skip nodes when they are not relevant to the tuple
           revision constraint.

------------------------------------------------------------
(***) Known problem test suites:

	 - The "resources" test suite has problems related to the
           refactor which changed the timing for purging old
           resources.

	 - In the "services" test suite, there are problems with:

	   - TestBasicIndexStuff_testNoSuchIndex needs to be
             revisited due to changed assumptions.

	   - TestDistributedTransactionServiceRestart

	   - TestDistributedTransactionService (known and deferred)

	 - RDF DB test errors.

These two were broken by revision# 1980, which included some magic
predicate related edits to TMUtility.

Access:

  - Efficient search on compressed keys (prefix, canonical huffman, or
    hu-tucker).

  - Random access to tuples in a leaf (for keyAt(), etc).  This does
    not have to be as efficient as the key search which is much more
    heavily used.

  - Fast extraction of the value, timestamp, and delete marker for a
    tuple.

  - Fast scan of tuples in either direction, materializing keys,
    values, timestamps, and/or delete flags.

  - Efficient merged iterator on two or more leaves with optional
    filter (used for storing asynchronous writes in a compressed
    form).

  - Parallel iterator scan at the ClientIndexView level (process the
    index partitions in parallel).  This should be implemented using a
    BlockingBuffer on the client.  The iterator is distributed in
    parallel to the DS.  Chunks are added to the client's blocking
    buffer as they arrive.  The max parallelism of the client index
    view should be respected for this operation.  The only real catch
    will be handling redirects for the unisolated index view.
    
    This flag should be used in the high-level query and turned on
    only for purposes where we can tolerate the partial delivery order
    of the parallel iterator.  In fact, we can probably tolerate that
    form most use cases but some care still needs to be excercised
    when enabling this.

    Compare performance with this flag against performance without the
    flag and against differing degrees of limited parallelism.

  - Fix the sparse row store splitter (must respect the logical row
    boundaries).

  - Raise AbstractBTreeTupleCursor::rangeCheck(final L leaf, final int
    index) into the ILeafData API?  The method signature would have to
    be changed to accept the optional fromKey and toKey constraints
    and the test would then be answered by the ILeafData
    implementation.

  - Strongly type the AbstractBTree's IAutoBox interface for the
    key/value types and link that with the ITupleSerializer types.

  - Fully implement the JDK 1.6 Map/Set interfaces.

B+Tree node buffering.

       - set of large native buffers.

       - hash map <UUID,addr> : <buffer#,offset>

       - strict unbounded LRU for eviction.

       - guard for node/leaf data access (latch) protect critical
         regions using a nested inc/dec approach and ensures that the
         data mapped to a given buffer and offset is neither moved nor
         evicted during access.  avoid guards across recursive methods
         since that can lead to deadlock with compact.

       - compact buffers - must not deadlock with record access as
         mediated by guards.

       - bitmap might help to write compact logic.

       - use an allocation unit for the slots in the buffer which is a
         multiple of some power of two, e.g., 128 or 256 bytes per
         slot.  all slots for a given record are contiguous.

       - Could use the same buffers for the index segment nodes
         region, but this raises the opportunity for fragmentation
         significantly.  This is a kind of double-buffering.  If the
         nodes region is not compressed but only the individual nodes,
         then the uncompressed nodes would also be buffered on a
         strict LRU basis.

       - Compact should maintain a free region at the end of each
         buffer, prefer to fill a buffer to capacity, and perform the
         minimum movement possible to fill gaps (incremental) or
         simply compact onto a different buffer (batch).  With buffer
         and buffer to buffer copy should be DMA.  The challenge is to
         hold all necessary locks so that we can relocate the records
         within or across buffers.

	 You know, this variable length record compacting thing is
	 exactly the problem that Java memory management is already
	 solving.  What I need to do is use normal java memory (since
	 it leaks native byte buffers) and impose a soft maximum on
	 the desired #of bytes allocated to B+Tree nodes, clear
	 references for nodes in an LRU pattern until the weakly
	 referenced byte count is LTE the soft maximum, and also track
	 the bytes recovered when weak references are cleared so I
	 know the min/max allocation.  There is some overhead for both
	 byte[] and a ByteBuffer, but not that much when compared to
	 the overhead of the byte[][] keys and values and the other
	 node/leaf metadata.

       - Reading from the store already returns a ByteBuffer on the
         heap.

       - The DiskOnlyStrategy already defines a read cache.  That
         could be refactored as an IIndexStore scope B+Tree node
         cache.  The records would be read from the underlying store
         and the obtained ByteBuffer would be entered into the cache.
         Since the cache is global, the key would have to be
         <UUID,addr> or <File,addr>.  The records should remain
         available until purged by the LRU policy even if the backing
         store is closed (in order words, do not attempt to remove
         records from the cache when the store is closed).  Purging
         records on delete of the backing store could be considered,
         but it is unlikely to be much benefit.  One way to do that is
         to scan from the LRU position backwards an arbitrary distance
         clearing references for any nodes associated with a deleted
         store.
	 
         The cache could also support write through so an newly
         persisted B+Tree node would either be buffered (if write
         through was enabled) or discarded (if it was not enabled).
	 
         While newly persisted nodes are unlikely to be re-read within
         the context of an ACID operation, they are relatively likely
         to be re-read within the context of following operation.

	 We could also install records into the cache when building an
	 index segment, but again that might not be a benefit.

Paul,

We are looking to tune the use of RAM to buffer B+Tree nodes and
leaves for the scale-out database.  I would expect that at least 50%
of the RAM should be dedicated to this task on each JVM instance.  I
am trying to decide on the approach to managing this memory.  I am
considering either (A) a large ByteBuffer on the native heap and
managing the memory myself; or (B) allocating a large number of
perfect fit ByteBuffers on the Java heap and letting the JVM manage
them.

As someone with roots in C, my first inclination is to allocate a
large ByteBuffer on the native heap and then manage the memory within
that buffer myself.  We made the decision to impose a constraint only
on the B+Tree branching factor, but not on the size of the B+Tree node
or leaf representation on the disk. This gives us perfect fit records
on the disk so the on disk image corresponds to perfect utilization
within the B+Tree even if nodes and leaves are not 100% full. As a
consequence, the B+Tree nodes and leaves use variable length records
rather than fixed size pages.  Given that, the buffer memory
management problem would probably rely on mechanisms such as those
already used by the JVM to handle Java allocations.  However, Java
already has great garbage collectors.

So it occurs to me that we might be better off allocating ByteBuffer's
on the Java heap and then letting the JVM manage the memory on our
behalf.  I believe that we could achieve the desired degree of
buffering using a hash map with weak reference values combined with a
hard reference retention cache using an LRU eviction policy.  If we
cleared hard references from the LRU position whenever the total of
the buffered byte[]s exceeded the desired percentage of the JVM heap,
then those byte[]s would be automatically discarded once they were
only weakly reachable.

While I would like to use native ByteBuffers for these data, but it is
my understanding that Java "leaks" ByteBuffer's whose backing storage
is on the native heap.  Also, it is my expectation that a large part
of the memory savings will come from operating on a binary image of
the B+Tree node/leaf rather than de-serializing the (de-compressed)
image read from the disk.  This will allow us to get rid of the
(de-)serialization time and the entailed memory demand on the Java
data structures used to model the nodes and leaves.  Running with the
expanded (deserialized Java objects) version of the B+Tree nodes and
leaves we typically buffer .3G of data on disk in RAM on a server with
a 12G JVM process.  I expect that we could increase that to 6G with
either of the proposed approaches, which would of course drammatically
improve the database performance by reducing IO Wait and
(de-)serialization costs.

I would appreciate it if you have any insight on this question which
you could share.

Thanks,

Faster Searches Key to a Greener Web
University of Glasgow (United Kingdom) (08/31/09) Forsyth, Stuart 

University of Glasgow researchers created a system using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to search a document index 20 times faster than a system based on standard processors. The researchers plan to develop the system for use in Web servers to speed up Internet searches, which they say would reduce the Internet's energy consumption and carbon cost. Estimates for the amount of carbon dioxide generated by a single Internet search request range from 0.2g per search, according to Google, to 7g per search, according to Harvard University physicist Alex Wisser-Gross. "Few people stop to think about the carbon costs of their computing," says project researcher Wim Vanderbauwhede. "By making Internet searches faster, servers will use less energy to produce results, even if the power consumption of the actual equipment is the same because they will use that energy for a fraction of the time." The researchers found that a system of two Xilinx FPGAs running the information retrieval and filtering algorithms for a document database were 20 times faster in returning results than a dual-core Intel Itanium-2 processor, and consumed only 1.25 watts each compared to the 130 watts consumed by the Itanium processor. The researchers plan to improve the performance of the current prototype and test it in a data center environment.

Tx attributes, e.g., for authentication information to support ACLs.
This can be an API on the ILocalTx object.  For an authenticated
client, we would add the appropriate attributes to the local tx.
Query, etc. can recover the txId from the view and do ACL stuff with
that.
