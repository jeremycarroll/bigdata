/**
 * Interface for (de-)serialization of addresses of child nodes and leaves as
 * recorded on a {@link Node}.
 * <p>
 * Note: it is possible to use additional information from the
 * {@link IAddressManager} associated with an {@link IRawStore} to decide how to
 * (de-)serialize the addresses. This does have the effect of making the binary
 * format of the serialized addresses different from store to store, e.g., if
 * the #of offset bits is different on the two stores. However, we do NOT copy
 * index nodes using a binary format from one store to another. Instead,
 * overflow processing uses an {@link ITupleIterator} to visit the keys and
 * values and replicate them onto the new store.
