/**
 * Implementation of an {@link ITripleStore} as a client of an
 * {@link IBigdataFederation}.
 * 
 * <h2>Deployment choices</h2>
 * 
 * You can deploy the {@link ScaleOutTripleStore} using any
 * {@link IBigdataClient}. The {@link LocalDataServiceFederation} preserves
 * full concurrency control and uses monolithic indices. An
 * {@link EmbeddedFederation} can be used if you want key-range partitioned
 * indices but plan to run on a single machine and do not want to incur the
 * overhead for RMI - all services will run in the same JVM. Finally, a
 * {@link JiniFederation} can be used if you want to use a scale-out deployment.
 * In this case indices will be key-range partitioned and will be automatically
 * re-distributed over the available resources.
 * 
 * <h2>Architecture</h2>
 * 
 * The client uses unisolated writes against the lexicon (terms and ids indices)
 * and the statement indices. The index writes are automatically broken down
 * into one split per index partition. While each unisolated write on an index
 * partition is ACID, the indices are fully consistent iff the total operation
 * is successfull. For the lexicon, this means that the write on the terms and
 * the ids index must both succeed. For the statement indices, this means that
 * the write on each access path must succeed. If a client fails while adding
 * terms, then it is possible for the ids index to be incomplete with respect to
 * the terms index (i.e., terms are mapped into the lexicon and term identifiers
 * are assigned but the reverse lookup by term identifier will not discover the
 * term). Likewise, if a client fails while adding statements, then it is
 * possible for some of the access paths to be incomplete with respect to the
 * other access paths (i.e., some statements are not present in some access
 * paths).
 * <p>
 * Two additional mechanisms are used in order to guarentee reads from only
 * fully consistent data. First, clients providing query answering should read
 * from a database state that is known to be consistent (by using a read-only
 * transaction whose start time is the globally agreed upon commit time for that
 * database state). Second, if a client operation fails then it must be retried.
 * Such fail-safe retry semantics are available when data load operations are
 * executed as part of a map-reduce job.
 * <p>
 * 
 * @todo provide a mechanism to make document loading robust to client failure.
 *       When loads are unisolated, a client failure can result in the
 *       statements being loaded into only a subset of the statement indices.
 *       robust load would require a means for undo or redo of failed loads. a
 *       loaded based on map/reduce would naturally provide a robust mechanism
 *       using a redo model. The {@link ConcurrentDataLoader} does much of this
 *       already.
 * 
 * @todo provide batching and synchronization for database at once and TM update
 *       scenarios with a distributed {@link ITripleStore}.
