/**
 * An address encodes both an int32 length and an int32 offset into a single
 * long integer. This limits the addressable size of a file to int32 bytes
 * (actually, only 2^31 bytes, e.g., 2G, since Java is using signed integers),
 * but that limit far exceeds the envisoned capacity of a single file in the
 * bigdata architecture. Note that the long integer ZERO (0L) is reserved and
 * always has the semantics of a <em>null</em> reference. Writes at offset
 * zero are allowed, depending on the store, by writes of zero length are
 * disallowed and hence no address will ever be ZERO (0L).
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @deprecated This is now an interface that is extended by {@link IRawStore}
 *             such that each store may be provisioned for a different split
 *             between the bits dedicated to the offset and the bits dedicated
 *             to the length of the data record. Only {@link #toLong(int, int)},
 *             {@link #getOffset(long)}, and {@link #getByteCount(long)} will
 *             need to become instance methods. The metadata required to recover
 *             the provisioned bit split must be stored in the root block of a
 *             persistence store so that it may be recovered without record to
 *             decoding an {@link Addr}. (This is also going to cause a lot of
 *             javadoc comments to refer to the "Addr" interface, which will be
 *             the base interface for {@link IRawStore} and that will be
 *             confusing and should be cleaned up.)
 *             <p>
 *             Other consequences are that offset and nextOffset are always long
 *             integers and that packing and unpacking of addresses requires
 *             knowledge of the #offset bits (so {@link SerializerUtil} should
 *             not be used for those cases). This change to serialization also
 *             effects how btree nodes and leaves are stored.
