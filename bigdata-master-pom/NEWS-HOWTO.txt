See the SF news guidelines [1] and the news archive[2] for examples.
The basic structure for postings is below.  Announcements should be
made to acknowledge significant contributions to the project, to disclose
known security problems, etc.

     - Title

     - A summary paragraph that introduces the module(s) or other
       topic relevant to the announcement.  This paragraph would be
       the same for each release of the same set of modules.

       Since many features are broken down into more than one module,
       announcements should speak to the feature rather than the specific
       modules.  If an annoucement is not linked to a specific release effort,
       then another topic paragraph must be crafted.

       A template should be crafted for security annoucements if that
       becomes relevant.

     - A 2nd paragraph describing the specific news event.  E.g., the
       new features in the current release or the relevance of this
       release to the other projects, etc.

     - A trailer paragraph describing the bigdata project.

       bigdata is a scale-out data and computing fabric designed for commodity
       hardware. See http://www.bigdata.com or
       http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/bigdata for more information.

     - URLs can be inline, but no HTML.  The use of [x] to place URLs
       at the bottom of the news article may conflict with the
       re-distribution of news.  It may be better to place URLs at the
       end of a paragraph per the SF news formatting guidelines.
