/**
 * This interface adds methods for allocating a record without writing any data
 * and for (re-)writing a slice of a record.
 * 
 * @todo This interface can be used to perform incremental writes for the block
 *       API. The client requests a blob reference of a given size. The data
 *       service allocates the space for that block on the raw store, obtaining
 *       its addr, and encapsulates this as a "blob" for the client. The client
 *       writes on the blob and the data service collects bytes to be written in
 *       a buffer. When the buffer overflows, the data services flushes it in an
 *       incremental write to the backing store using this method.
 * 
 * @todo the other use case for this is the {@link IndexSegmentBuilder} which
 *       needs to be able to allocate the block (obtaining its address) before
 *       it writes the block, so either a "write-update" or an "alloc-update".
 *       this is required in order to get the prior/next leaf references into
 *       place in the generated store file.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @deprecated I believe that we can safely get rid of this interface and its
 *             functionality. The {@link IndexSegmentBuilder} will just buffer
 *             the prior and current records itself and then write them onto an
 *             {@link IWriteCache}. The blob stuff can be handled better by
 *             writing into a file system (large blobs) or chaining together
 *             blocks (small blobs ala the {@link PSOutputStream}).
