# This configuration file is designed to connect to a bigdata instance using
# an http SPARQL endpoint.  The [ontology] and [data] fields will be ignored.
# The ontology and data must be loaded into the database using a separate
# utility, such as the DataLoader.  See build.xml.  The [database] is just
# the SPARQL endpoint.
