/**
 * Persistent object wrapping a persistent {@link BTree} together with the
 * {@link Coercer}, {@link Successor}, and {@link Comparator} objects for use
 * with that btree.
 * <h2>Implementation notes</h2>
 * <p>
 * The current approach uses an unnamed {@link BTree} and explicitly manages the
 * BTree on the journal. In particular, methods that change the state of the
 * BTree cause this object to be {@link #update() marked as dirty} so that we
 * will flush the {@link BTree} to the journal in {@link #saveBTree()} and have
 * the current {@link IndexMetadata} record on hand when this object is
 * serialized. This works fine until we start using partitioned indices in the
 * journal - the problem in that case is that the low-level integration will not
 * be able to keep track of the partitioned indices.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An alternative approach is to use named scale-out indices for the link set
 * indices. A scale-out index is created for each link set index family (the
 * association property plus a value property). The keys for the scale-out index
 * are formed as:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *            [linkSetOid][attribute]([oid])?
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The [linkSetOid] is used as the prefix for the keys stored in the scale-out
 * index. In this manner the scale-out index is automatically broken down into
 * key ranges for each distinct link set.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The scale-out indices would be named by the concatenation of the association
 * class and value property class for the link set family. Either the object
 * identifiers for those property classes or the names of the property classes
 * may be used for this purpose. E.g., "___employee___name" might be the name of
 * the scale-out index for the association class "employee" and the value
 * property "name".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When using scale-out indices in this manner the add, rebuild, and drop index
 * operations will need to be modified such that they operation only on the
 * entries in the scale-out index which correspond to the link set for which the
 * operation was requested.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: the reason not to use a distinct named scale-out indices for each link
 * set index is that the total number of resulting link set indices could be
 * quite large. This would not be a problem for something like rdf-generic but
 * it could be a problem if there were 10k+ link set indices on a single journal
 * all of which were quite small. If those link set indices correspond to named
 * scale-out indices then each one needs to be examine when we overflow the
 * journal. It might be fine...but it might be a problem. Also, the named
 * indices would (of course) need to be placed within their own name space to
 * avoid, which is not a problem.
 * </p>
