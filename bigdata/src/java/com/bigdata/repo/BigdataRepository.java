/**
 * A distributed file system with extensible metadata and atomic append
 * implemented using the bigdata scale-out architecture. Files have a client
 * assigned identifier, which is a Unicode string. The file identifier MAY be
 * structured so as to look like a hierarchical file system using any desired
 * convention. Files are versioned and historical versions MAY be accessed until
 * the next compacting merge discards their data. File data is stored in large
 * {@link #BLOCK_SIZE} blocks, but partial and even empty blocks are allowed.
 * Storage is space - only the data written will be stored.
 * <p>
 * Efficient method are offered for streaming and block oriented IO. All block
 * read and write operations are atomic, including block append. Files may be
 * easily written such that records never cross a block boundary by the
 * expediency of flushing the output stream if a record would overflow the
 * current block. (A flush forces the atomic write of a partial block. Partial
 * blocks are stored efficiently - only the bytes actually written are stored.)
 * Such files are well-suited to map/reduce processing as they may be
 * efficiently split at block boundaries and references to the blocks
 * distributed to clients. Likewise, reduce clients can aggregate data into
 * large files suitable for further map/reduce processing.
 * <p>
 * The distributed file system uses two scale-out indices to support ACID
 * operations on file metadata and atomic file append. These ACID guarentees
 * arise from the use of unisolated operations on the respective indices and
 * therefore apply only to the individual file metadata or file block
 * operations. In particular, file metadata read and write are atomic and all
 * individual file block IO (read,write,and append) operations are atomic.
 * Atomicity is NOT guarenteed when performing more than a single file block IO
 * operation, e.g., multiple appends MIGHT NOT write sequential blocks since
 * other block operations could have intervened.
 * <p>
 * The content length of the file is not stored as file metadata. Instead it MAY
 * be estimated by a range count of the index entries spanned by the file's
 * data. The exact file size may be readily determined when reading small files
 * by the expediency of sucking the entire file into a buffer - all reads are at
 * least one block. Streaming processing is advised in all cases when handling
 * large files, including when the file is to be delivered via HTTP.
 * <p>
 * The metadata index uses a {@link SparseRowStore} design, similar to Google's
 * bigtable or Hadoop's HBase. Certain properties MUST be defined for each entry -
 * they are documented on the {@link MetadataSchema}. Applications are free to
 * define additional properties. Reads and writes of file metadata are always
 * atomic.
 * <p>
 * Each time a file is created a new version number is assigned. The data index
 * uses the {@link MetadataSchema#ID} as the first field in a compound key. The
 * second field is the {@link MetadataSchema#VERSION} - a 32-bit integer. The
 * remainder of the key is a 64-bit block identifier. The block identifiers are
 * strictly monotonic (e.g., up one) and their sequence orders the blocks into
 * the logical byte order of the file.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Use cases</h2>
 * <p>
 * Use case: A REST-ful repository. Documents may be stored, updated, read,
 * deleted, and searched using a full text index.
 * <p>
 * Use case: A map/reduce master reads document metadata using an index scan. It
 * examines the data index's {@link MetadataIndex} (that is, the index that
 * knows where each partition of the scale-out data index is stored) and
 * determines which map clients are going to be "close" to each document and
 * then hands off the document to one of those map clients.
 * <p>
 * Use case: The same as the use case above, but large files are being processed
 * and there is a requirement to "break" the files into splits and hand off the
 * splits. This can be achieved by estimating the file system using a range
 * count and multiplying through by the block size. Blocks may be handed off to
 * the clients in parallel (of course, clients need to deal with the hassle of
 * processing files where records will cross split boundaries unless they always
 * pad out with unused bytes to the next 64k boundary).
 * <p>
 * Use case: A reduce client wants to write a very large files so it creates a
 * metadata record for the file and then does a series of atomic appears to the
 * file.
 * 
 * @todo describe the relationship to the media redundency system. unless the
 *       replication factor is part of the key all files in a file system will
 *       have the same replication factor (the journals are mirrored, leading to
 *       mirrored index partitions). Is there any way to achieve per file
 *       replication quotas? Perhaps just choose the partition of the file
 *       system, e.g., <code>/highly-available</code> might be given on
 *       guarentee while other prefixes have a different guarentee - that seems
 *       simple enough. The availability can be managed by changing what data is
 *       on an index partition. If availability prefixes are created then we
 *       could juggle the separator keys to correspond to exact partition
 *       boundaries so that we never over-replicate a file because it's lumped
 *       with a highly available partition.
 * 
 * @todo multiple file systems can be easily created but that seems to just
 *       create problems since the file identifers are no longer sufficient to
 *       locate a file.
 * 
 * @todo provide scans for file versions, e.g., given a file, what versions
 *       exist.
 * 
 * @todo compacting merge policies. consider how data is eradicated from the
 *       metadata and data indices and that it might not be "atomically"
 *       eradicated so it is quite possible that only some data will remain
 *       available after a period of time. the policy can set the minimum
 *       criteria, e.g., in terms of time and #of versions to be retained. After
 *       those criteria have been met you may still find your data or not. You
 *       can read blocks directly for a file version and blocks that have not
 *       been eradicated will still have valid data.
 * 
 * @todo should compression be applied? applications are obviously free to apply
 *       their own compression, but it could be convienent to stored compressed
 *       blocks. the caller could specify the compression method on a per block
 *       basis (we don't want to lookup the file metadata for this). the
 *       compression method would be written into a block header. blocks can
 *       always be decompressed by examining the header.
 * 
 * @todo Full text indexing support. Perhaps the best way to handle this is to
 *       queue document metadata up for a distributed full text indexing
 *       service. The service accepts metadata for documents from the queue and
 *       decides whether or not the document should be indexed based on its
 *       metadata and how the document should be processed if it is to be
 *       indexed. Those business rules would be registered with the full text
 *       indexing service. (Alternatively, they can be configured with the
 *       {@link BigdataRepository} and applied locally as the blocks of the file
 *       are written into the repository. That's certainly easier right off the
 *       bat.)
 * 
 * @todo full transactions could be used to perform atomic updates on the file
 *       metadata. in a way this is easier than resorting to a distinct locking
 *       mechanism. file data writes MUST be outside of the transaction.
 * 
 * @todo ensure that index partitions do not break across the metadata record
 *       for a file.
 * 
 * @todo there should be some constraints on the file identifier but it general
 *       it represents a client determined absolute file path name. It is
 *       certainly possible to use a flat file namespace, but you can just as
 *       readily use a hierarchical one. Unicode characters are supported in the
 *       file identifiers.
 * 
 * @todo create an abstract base class and derive two versions: one runs against
 *       and embedded data service (supports restart but does not use jini) and
 *       the other runs against a federation (scale-out deployment).
