/**
 * <p>
 * An interface for managing transaction life cycles.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Concurrency control</h2>
 * <p>
 * The underlying concurrency control mechanism is Multi-Version Concurrency
 * Control (MVCC). There are no "write locks" per say. Instead, a transaction
 * reads from a historical commit point identified by its assigned start time
 * (-startTime is a timestamp which identifies the commit point) and writes on
 * an isolated write set visible only to that transaction. When a read-write
 * transaction commits, its write set is validated against the then current
 * committed state of the database. If validation succeeds, the isolated write
 * set is merged down onto the database. Otherwise the transaction is aborted
 * and its write set is discarded.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A transaction imposes "read locks" on the resources required for the
 * historical state of the database from which that transaction is reading.
 * Those resources will not be released until the transaction is complete or
 * aborted (the transaction manager MAY choose to abort a read in order to
 * release locked resources).
 * </p>
 * <h2>Centralized transaction manager service</h2>
 * <p>
 * When deployed as a distributed database there will be a centralized service
 * implementing this interface and clients will discover and talk with that
 * service. The centralized service in turn will coordinate the distributed
 * transactions with the various {@link IDataService}s using their local
 * implementations of this same interface. The centralized transactin service
 * SHOULD invoke the corresponding methods on a {@link IDataService} IFF it
 * knows that the {@link IDataService} is buffering writes for the transaction.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Timestamps</h2>
 * <p>
 * Timestamps are used to indicate whether an operation is a historical
 * read-only transaction (-startTime), a fully isolated read-write (startTime),
 * a read-committed operation ({@link ITx#READ_COMMITTED}), or an unisolated
 * read-write operation ({@link ITx#UNISOLATED}}. Timestamps for fully
 * isolated read-write transactions MUST be obtained from an
 * {@link ITransactionManager}. Likewise, a read-only transaction obtained from
 * an {@link ITransactionManager} will cause the resources necessary to support
 * that read to be retained until the transaction has completed. The value
 * <code>-startTime</code> MAY be used to perform a lightweight read-only
 * operations without coordination with the {@link ITransactionManager} but
 * resources MAY be released since no read "locks" have been declared.
 * </p>
 * A transaction identifier serves to uniquely distinguish transactions. The
 * practice is to assign transaction identifies based on the timestamp of their
 * view and to reverse the sign for read-write transaction identifiers are
 * negative values (essentially negative timestamps) while commit times are
 * positive values (timestamps). Successive read-write transactions must be
 * assigned transaction identifiers whose absolute value is strictly increasing -
 * this requirement is introduced by the MVCC protocol. There are special values
 * for {@link ITx#UNISOLATED} and {@link ITx#READ_COMMITTED} operations, which
 * are not transactions at all.
 * <p>

 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * FIXME My recommendation based on the above is to go with a centralized time
 * service and to use a heartbeat to drive distributed commits of both isolated
 * and unisolated transactions. the group commit protocol can wait for a
 * suitable heartbeat to make the data restart safe.
 * 
 * @todo The transaction server should make sure that time does not go backwards
 *       when it starts up (with respect to the last time that it issued).
 *       
 * @todo Since the overall concurrency control algorithm is MVCC, the
 *       {@link ITransactionManager} becomes aware of the required locks during
 *       the active {@link ITx#isActive()} phase of the transaction. By the time
 *       the transaction is done executing and a COMMIT is requested by the
 *       client the {@link ITransactionManagerService} knows the set of
 *       resources (named indices) on which the transaction has written. As its
 *       first step in the commit protocol the
 *       {@link ITransactionManagerService} acquires the necessary exclusive
 *       locks on those resources. The locks are eventually released when the
 *       transaction either commits or aborts.
 * 
 * FIXME in order to support 2-/3-phase commit, the [commitTime] from the
 * transaction manager service must be passed through to the journal rather than
 * being returned from {@link #commit(long)}. There also needs to be a distinct
 * "prepare" message that validates the write set of the transaction and makes
 * it restart safe. finally, i have to coordinate the serialization of the wait
 * for the "commit" message. (The write set of the transaction also needs to be
 * restart safe when it indicates that it has "prepared" so that a commit will
 * eventually succeed.)
 * 
 * FIXME extends {@link Remote} and declare {@link IOException} for all methods
 * on this interface.

     * The concurrency control algorithm is MVCC, so readers never block and
     * only write-write conflicts can arise. It is possible to register an index
     * with an {@link IConflictResolver} in order to present the application
     * with an opportunity to validate write-write conflicts using state-based
     * techniques (i.e., by looking at the records and timestamps and making an
     * informed decision).

     *            The isolation level. The following isolation levels are

     *            on the resources required for that historical state of the
     *            database.</dd>
     *            <dt>{@link IsolationEnum#ReadWrite}</dt>
     *            <dd>A fully isolated read-write transaction.</dd>

     * 
     * @return The transaction start time, which serves as the unique identifier
     *         for the transaction.
     * 
     * FIXME Modify this to accept an optional timestamp so that the caller can
     * request a historical read with "read locks" on the resources required for
     * that historical committed state. When the optional timestamp is 0L the
     * transaction manager will assign a timestamp. For a read-only transaction
     * the timestamp will identify the most recent committed state of the
     * database (it will in fact be a distinct timestamp not less than the last
     * assigned commit time). For a read-write transaction it will be a distinct
     * timestamp not less than the last assigned commit time. When a historical
     * read is specified for a caller supplied timestamp an exception (or other
     * indication) should be given to the caller to indicate that they are not
     * the only client reading from that timestamp - what is at issue here is
     * that the "read locks" will be released as soon as the historical read is
     * completed - and any client can cause it to be completed, so it two
     * clients are using the same timestamp then one could inadvertently cause
     * the read locks to be released too early. Another way to handle this is to
     * return a timestamp distinct from any active historical read tx, but we
     * could run out of timestamps under some very high concurrency scenarios in
     * which case the caller might be delayed the start of their historical
     * read.
     * 
     * @todo a heartbeat could be sent to all clients (and data services) from
     *       the {@link ITransactionManager} giving the most recent commit time
     *       on the database. this is useful for clients that want a
     *       light-weight historical read (no read locks, not read-committed).
     *       <P>
     *       this could be extended for the RDF inference case to give the last
     *       read-behind closure time as well.
