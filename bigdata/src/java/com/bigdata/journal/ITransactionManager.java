     * Create a new transaction.
     * <p>
     * The concurrency control algorithm is MVCC, so readers never block and
     * only write-write conflicts can arise. It is possible to register an
     * {@link UnisolatedBTree} with an {@link IConflictResolver} in order to
     * present the application with an opportunity to validate write-write
     * conflicts using state-based techniques (i.e., by looking at the records
     * and timestamps and making an informed decision).
     * <p>
     * MVCC requires a strategy to release old versions that are no longer
     * accessible to active transactions. bigdata uses a highly efficient
     * technique in which writes are multiplexed onto append-only
     * {@link Journal}s and then evicted on overflow into {@link IndexSegment}s
     * using a bulk index build mechanism. Old journal and index segment
     * resources are simply deleted from the file system some time after they
     * are no longer accessible to active transactions.
     * 
     * @param level
     *            The isolation level. The following isolation levels are
     *            supported:
     *            <dl>
     *            <dt>{@link IsolationEnum#ReadCommitted}</dt>
     *            <dd>A read-only transaction in which data become visible
     *            within the transaction as concurrent transactions commit. This
     *            is suitable for very long read processes that do not require a
     *            fully consistent view of the data.</dd>
     *            <dt>{@link IsolationEnum#ReadOnly}</dt>
     *            <dd>A fully isolated read-only transaction.</dd>
     *            <dt>{@link IsolationEnum#ReadWrite}</dt>
     *            <dd>A fully isolated read-write transaction.</dd>
     *            </dl>
     * 
     * @return The transaction start time, which serves as the unique identifier
     *         for the transaction.
