/**
 * A client-facing interface for managing transaction life cycles. An instance
 * of this class is used to assign both transaction start times (also known as
 * transaction identifiers) and transaction commit times and which are stored in
 * root blocks of the various stored that participate in a given database and
 * reported via {@link #getFirstCommitTime()} and {@link #getLastCommitTime()}).
 * <p>
 * While the transaction "start" and commit "times" these do not strictly
 * speaking have to be "times" they do have to be assigned using the same
 * measure, so this implies either a coordinated time server or a strictly
 * increasing counter. Regardless, we need to know "when" a transaction commits
 * as well as "when" it starts. Also note that we need to assign "commit times"
 * even when the operation is unisolated. This means that we have to coordinate
 * an unisolated commit on a store that is part of a distributed database with
 * the centralized transaction manager. This should be done as part of the group
 * commit since we are waiting at that point anyway to optimize IO by minimizing
 * syncs to disk.
 * <p>
 * A transaction identifier serves to uniquely distinguish transactions. The
 * practice is to use strictly increasing non-ZERO long integer values for
 * transaction identifiers. The strictly increasing requirement is introduced by
 * the MVCC protocol. The non-ZERO requirement is introduced by the APIs since
 * they interpret a 0L transaction identifier as an
 * <code>unisolated operation</code> - that is, not as a transaction at all.
 * <p>
 * It is much simpler to use a unique long integer counter for transaction
 * identifiers than to rely on timestamps. Counters are simpler because there is
 * no reliance on system clocks, which can be reset or adjusted by a variety of
 * mechanisms and which have to be continually synchronized across failover
 * transaction identifier services. In contract, a transaction identifier based
 * solely on a counter is much simpler but is decoupled from the notion of wall
 * clock time. In either case, a store SHOULD refuse a commit where the
 * transaction "commit time" appears to go backward.
 * <p>
 * If a counter is used to assign transaction start and commit "times" then the
 * service SHOULD keep the time at which that transaction identifier was
 * generated persistently on hand so that we are able to roll back the system to
 * the state corresponding to some moment in time (assuming that all relevant
 * history is on hand). When using a counter, there can be multiple transactions
 * that start or end within the resolution of the "moment". E.g., within the
 * same millisecond given a transaction identifier service associated with a
 * clock having millisecond precision (especially if it has less than
 * millisecond accuracy).
 * 
 * FIXME My recommendation based on the above is to go with a centralized time
 * service and to use a heartbeat to drive distributed commits of both isolated
 * and unisolated transactions. the group commit protocol can wait for a
 * suitable heartbeat to make the data restart safe.
 * 
 * @todo The transaction server should make sure that time does not go backwards
 *       when it starts up (with respect to the last time that it issued).
 * 
 * @todo Condider decoupling from the {@link ITimestampService} or folding it
 *       into this class since {@link ITimestampService} may get used to readily
 *       and the timestamp mechanisms of the {@link ITransactionManager} are
 *       quite specialized.

     * The concurrency control algorithm is MVCC, so readers never block and
     * only write-write conflicts can arise. It is possible to register an
     * {@link UnisolatedBTree} with an {@link IConflictResolver} in order to
     * present the application with an opportunity to validate write-write
     * conflicts using state-based techniques (i.e., by looking at the records
     * and timestamps and making an informed decision).
     * <p>
     * MVCC requires a strategy to release old versions that are no longer
     * accessible to active transactions. bigdata uses a highly efficient
     * technique in which writes are multiplexed onto append-only
     * {@link Journal}s and then evicted on overflow into {@link IndexSegment}s
     * using a bulk index build mechanism. Old journal and index segment
     * resources are simply deleted from the file system some time after they
     * are no longer accessible to active transactions.

     *            <dd>A read-only transaction in which data become visible
     *            within the transaction as concurrent transactions commit. This
     *            is suitable for very long read processes that do not require a
     *            fully consistent view of the data.</dd>
     *            <dt>{@link IsolationEnum#ReadOnly}</dt>
     *            <dd>A fully isolated read-only transaction.</dd>
     *            <dt>{@link IsolationEnum#ReadWrite}</dt>
