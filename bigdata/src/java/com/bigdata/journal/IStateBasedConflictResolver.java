/**
 * <p>
 * An interface invoked during backward validation when a write-write conflict
 * has been detected. The interface must either resolve the write-write conflict
 * by returning a new version in which the conflict is resolved or report an
 * unresolvable conflict, in which case backward validation will force the
 * transaction to abort.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @see http://www.cs.brown.edu/~mph/Herlihy90a/p96-herlihy.pdf for an excellent
 *      discussion of data type specific state-based conflict resolution,
 *      including examples for things such as bank accounts.
 * 
 * @todo Write tests in which we do state-based conflict resolution for both the
 *       bank account examplres in Herlihy and the examples that we will find in
 *       race conditions for the lexical terms and statements in an RDF model.
 * 
 * @todo How are write-delete conflicts represented? How are they handled?
 * 
 * @todo Does the resolver need any metadata about the transaction? It probably
 *       does require metadata for deserialization of objects.
 * 
 * @todo Will object deserialization be buffered by a cache? Cache integrity is
 *       tricky here since the objects being reconciled belong to different
 *       transactional states.
