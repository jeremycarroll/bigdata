/**
 * <p>
 * An object journal for very fast write absorbtion. The journal supports
 * concurrent fully isolated transactions and is designed to absorb writes
 * destined for a read-optimized database file. Writes are logically appended to
 * the journal to minimize disk head movement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The journal provides for fast migration of committed data to a read-optimized
 * database. Data may be migrated as soon as a transaction commits and only the
 * most recent state for any datum need be migrated. Note that the criteria for
 * migration typically are met before the slots occupied by those objects may be
 * released. This is because a concurrent transaction must be permitted to read
 * from the committed state of the database at the time that the transaction was
 * begun.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The journal is a ring buffer divised of slots. The slot size and initial
 * extent are specified when the journal is provisioned. Objects are written
 * onto free slots. Slots are released once no active transaction can read from
 * that slots. In this way, the journal buffers consistent histories.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The journal maintains two indices:
 * <ol>
 * <li>An object index from int32 object identifier to a slot allocation; and
 * </li>
 * <li>An allocation index from slot to a slot status record.</li>
 * </ol>
 * These data structures are b+trees. The nodes of the btrees are stored in the
 * journal. These data structures are fully isolated. The roots of the indices
 * are choosen based on the transaction begin time. Changes result in a copy on
 * write. Writes percolate up the index nodes to the root node.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Commit processing. The journal also maintains two root blocks. When the
 * journal is wired into memory, incremental writes are absorbed by the journal
 * into a direct buffer and written through to disk. Writes are flushed to disk
 * on commit. Commit processing also updates the root blocks using the Challis
 * algorithm. (The root blocks are updated using an alternating pattern and
 * timestamps are recorded at the head and tail of each root block to detect
 * partial writes.)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A journal may be used without a database file as an object database. The
 * design is very efficient for absorbing writes, but read operations are not
 * optimized. Overall performance will degrade as the journal size increases
 * beyond the limits of physical memory and as the object index depth increases.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A journal and a database file form a logical segment in the bigdata
 * distributed database architecture. In bigdata, the segment size is generally
 * limited to a few hundred megabytes. At this scale, the journal and database
 * may both be wired into memory for the fastest performance. If memory
 * constraits are tighted, these files may be memory-mapped or used as a
 * disk-base data structures. A single journal may buffer for multiple copies of
 * the same database segment or journals may be chained for redundancy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Very large objects should be handled by specially provisioned database files
 * using large pages and a "never overwrite" strategy.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo There is a dependency in a distributed database architecture on
 *       transaction begin time. A very long running transaction could force the
 *       journal to hold onto historical states. If a decision is made to
 *       discard those states and the transaction begins to read from the
 *       journal then the transaction must be rolled back.
 * 
 * @todo Define distributed transaction protocol.
 * 
 * @todo Define distributed protocol for robust startup, operation, and
 *       failover.
 * 
 * @todo Implement forward validation and state-based conflict resolution with
 *       custom merge rules for persistent objects, generic objects, and btree
 *       index nodes.
 * 
 * @todo Divide into API layers. The network facing layer uses a single threaded
 *       nio interface to receive writes into direct buffers. Writes on the
 *       journal are also single-threaded. Buffers of rows are queued by one
 *       thread and then written through to the journal by another. Isolation
 *       occurs in a layer above raw journal writes that maintains the object
 *       and allocation indices. Rows can be written onto slots using simple
 *       math since both the row size and the slot size are known. Objects must
 *       be deserialized during state-based validation if a conflict is
 *       detected.
 * 
 * @todo Refactor btree support for journals.
 * 
 * @todo Flushing to disk on commit could be optional, e.g., if there are
 *       redundent journals then this is not required.
 * 
 * @todo cache index and allocation nodes regardless of the strategy.
 * 
 * @todo cache objects? They are materialized only for state-based validation.
 *       If possible, validation should occur in its own layer so that the basic
 *       store can handle IO using either byte[] or streams (allocated from a
 *       high concurrency queue to minimize stream creation overhead).
