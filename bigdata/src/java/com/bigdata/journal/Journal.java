/**
 * <p>
 * The {@link Journal} is an append-only persistence capable data structure
 * supporting atomic commit, named indices, and transactions. Writes are
 * logically appended to the journal to minimize disk head movement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Commit processing. The journal maintains two root blocks. Commit updates the
 * root blocks using the Challis algorithm. (The root blocks are updated using
 * an alternating pattern and timestamps are recorded at the head and tail of
 * each root block to detect partial writes.) When the journal is backed by a
 * disk file, the data
 * {@link Options#FORCE_ON_COMMIT optionally flushed to disk on commit}. If
 * desired, the writes may be flushed before the root blocks are updated to
 * ensure that the writes are not reordered - see {@link Options#DOUBLE_SYNC}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This class does NOT provide a thread-safe implementation of the
 * {@link IRawStore} API. Writes on the store MUST be serialized. Transaction
 * that write on the store are automatically serialized by {@link #commit(long)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: transaction processing MAY occur be concurrent since the write set of a
 * each transaction is written on a distinct {@link TemporaryRawStore}.
 * However, each transaction is NOT thread-safe and MUST NOT be executed by more
 * than one concurrent thread. Typically, a thread pool of some fixed size is
 * created and transctions are assigned to threads when they start on the
 * journal. If and as necessary, the {@link TemporaryRawStore} will spill from
 * memory onto disk allowing scalable transactions (up to 2G per transactions).
 * </p>
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * FIXME Priority items are:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Transaction isolation (correctness tests, isolatedbtree tests, fused
 * view tests).</li>
 * <li> Concurrent load for RDFS w/o rollback.</li>
 * <li> Group commit for higher transaction throughput.<br>
 * Note: TPS is basically constant for a given combination of the buffer mode
 * and whether or not commits are forced to disk. This means that the #of
 * clients is not a strong influence on performance. The big wins are Transient
 * and Force := No since neither conditions synchs to disk. This suggests that
 * the big win for TPS throughput is going to be group commit. </li>
 * <li> Scale out database (automatic re-partitioning of indices and processing
 * of deletion markers).</li>
 * <li> AIO for the Direct and Disk modes.</li>
 * <li> Distributed database protocols.</li>
 * <li> Segment server (mixture of journal server and read-optimized database
 * server).</li>
 * <li> Testing of an "embedded database" using both a journal only and a
 * journal + read-optimized database design. This can be tested up to the GPO
 * layer.</li>
 * <li>Support primary key (clustered) indices in GPO/PO layer.</li>
 * <li>Implement backward validation and state-based conflict resolution with
 * custom merge rules for RDFS, persistent objects, generic objects, and primary
 * key indices, and secondary indexes.</li>
 * <li> Architecture using queues from GOM to journal/database segment server
 * supporting both embedded and remote scenarios.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * @todo There is a dependency in a distributed database architecture on
 *       transaction begin time. A very long running transaction could force the
 *       journal to hold onto historical states. If a decision is made to
 *       discard those states and the transaction begins to read from the
 *       journal then the transaction must be rolled back. This should be worked
 *       out with the resource deallocation for old journals and segments.
 * 
 * @todo Define distributed transaction protocol.
 * 
 * @todo Define distributed protocol for robust startup, operation, and
 *       failover.
 * 
 * @todo Divide into API layers. The network facing layer uses a single threaded
 *       nio interface to receive writes into direct buffers. Writes on the
 *       journal are also single-threaded. Buffers of rows are queued by one
 *       thread and then written through to the journal by another. Isolation
 *       occurs in a layer above raw journal writes that maintains the object
 *       and allocation indices. Rows can be written onto slots using simple
 *       math since both the row size and the slot size are known. Objects must
 *       be deserialized during state-based validation if a conflict is
 *       detected.
 * 
 * @todo I need to revisit the assumptions for very large objects in the face of
 *       the recent / planned redesign. I expect that using an index with a key
 *       formed as [URI][chuck#] would work just fine. Chunks would then be
 *       limited to 32k or so. Writes on such indices should probably be
 *       directed to a journal using a disk-only mode.
 * 
 * @todo Checksums and/or record compression are currently handled on a per-{@link BTree}
 *       or other persistence capable data structure basis. It is nice to be
 *       able to choose for which indices and when ( {@link Journal} vs
 *       {@link IndexSegment}) to apply these algorithms. However, it might be
 *       nice to factor their application out a bit into a layered api - as long
 *       as the right layering is correctly re-established on load of the
 *       persistence data structure.
