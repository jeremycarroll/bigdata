/**
 * <p>
 * An append-only persistence capable data structure supporting atomic commit,
 * scalable named indices, and transactions. Writes are logically appended to
 * the journal to minimize disk head movement.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The journal provides for fast migration of committed data to a read-optimized
 * database. Data may be migrated as soon as a transaction commits and only the
 * most recent state for any datum need be migrated. Note that the criteria for
 * migration typically are met before the slots occupied by those objects may be
 * released. This is because a concurrent transaction must be permitted to read
 * from the committed state of the database at the time that the transaction was
 * begun.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The journal is a ring buffer divised of slots. The slot size and initial
 * extent are specified when the journal is provisioned. Objects are written
 * onto free slots. Slots are released once no active transaction can read from
 * that slots. In this way, the journal buffers consistent histories.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The journal maintains two indices:
 * <ol>
 * <li>An object index from int32 object identifier to a slot allocation; and
 * </li>
 * <li>An allocation index from slot to a slot status record.</li>
 * </ol>
 * These data structures are b+trees. The nodes of the btrees are stored in the
 * journal. These data structures are fully isolated. The roots of the indices
 * are choosen based on the transaction begin time. Changes result in a copy on
 * write. Writes percolate up the index nodes to the root node.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Commit processing. The journal also maintains two root blocks. Commit updates
 * the root blocks using the Challis algorithm. (The root blocks are updated
 * using an alternating pattern and timestamps are recorded at the head and tail
 * of each root block to detect partial writes.) When the journal is backed by a
 * disk file, the file is flushed to disk on commit.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A journal may be used without a database file as an object database. The
 * design is very efficient for absorbing writes, but read operations are not
 * optimized. Overall performance will degrade as the journal size increases
 * beyond the limits of physical memory and as the object index depth increases.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A journal and a database file form a logical segment in the bigdata
 * distributed database architecture. In bigdata, the segment size is generally
 * limited to a few hundred megabytes. At this scale, the journal and database
 * may both be wired into memory for the fastest performance. If memory
 * constraits are tighted, these files may be memory-mapped or used as a
 * disk-base data structures. A single journal may buffer for multiple copies of
 * the same database segment or journals may be chained for redundancy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Very large objects should be handled by specially provisioned database files
 * using large pages and a "never overwrite" strategy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This class is NOT thread-safe. Instances of this class MUST use a
 * single-threaded context. That context is the single-threaded journal server
 * API. The journal server may be either embedded (in which case objects are
 * migrated to the server using FIFO queues) or networked (in which case the
 * journal server exposes a non-blocking service with a single thread for reads,
 * writes and deletes on the journal).

 * FIXME Priority items are:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Segment server (mixture of journal server and read-optimized database
 * server).</li>
 * <li> Persistence capable data structures for the object index (basically, a
 * btree) and the allocation indices. The allocation index is less clear, but a
 * BitSet will do until I settle on something better - one of the tricks no
 * matter how you approach it is getting closure on the self-referential issue
 * with slots and a slot allocation index; maybe the per-tx data structure is
 * just transient will the committed data structure is persistent?</li>
 * <li> Transaction isolation.</li>
 * <li> Commit protocol, including plan for PREPARE in support of distributed
 * transactions.</li>
 * <li> Migration of data to a read-optimized database (have to implement the
 * read-optimized database as well). Explore use of page at a time compression
 * of rows. Compression makes it possible to fit more data on a logical page.
 * Overflow of rows on a logical page forces use of continuation pages.</li>
 * <li> Testing of an "embedded database" using both a journal only and a
 * journal + read-optimized database design. This can be tested up to the GPO
 * layer.</li>
 * <li>Support primary key (clustered) indices in GPO/PO layer.</li>
 * <li>Implement forward validation and state-based conflict resolution with
 * custom merge rules for persistent objects, generic objects, and primary key
 * indices, and secondary indexes.</li>
 * <li> Architecture using queues from GOM to journal/database segment server
 * supporting both embedded and remote scenarios.</li>
 * <li> Distributed database protocols.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * FIXME Document the sources of latency and stages of identifer resolution for
 * bigdata
 * <ul>
 * <li>Transaction identifiers must be generated by a central source, which is
 * a source of latency.</li>
 * <li>A client must resolve each new segment identifer a service on a host. If
 * the segment is moved, the client must be notified or rediscover the location
 * of the segment (service and host) (multiple services on a host to let us
 * access all RAM using Java)</li>
 * <li>A segment identifier is resolved to a journal and database extent by a
 * service using an in-memory hash table.</li>
 * <li>An int32 identifier must be resolved against the journal first, if there
 * is a journal for that segment. If the journal is fully buffered, then this
 * will have low latency. Otherwise, we need a mixture of per-transaction hash
 * table (fast hits on data versions written within that transaction), an object
 * index with a high branch factor (fast access times to historical versions on
 * the journal) and perhaps a bloom filter in front of the persistent global
 * object index (weeds out most misses and transactional isolation has already
 * been handled). </li>
 * <li>A miss on the journal requires a read on the database segment. The
 * database uses a direct mapping of the int32 identifier to a logical page. The
 * logical page is a real page. The row on the page is found using a slot map.
 * If the logical page overflows, then some rows will be moved onto continuation
 * page(s). This means ONE(1) disk access (without cache hits) in the common
 * case, but overflow can result in chasing a page chain. If overflow proves
 * common, then we could list the continuation pages directly so that there was
 * never more than TWO (2) disk accesses to retrieve a page. We always read a
 * page at a time on the database and send back the entire page to the client.
 * We need to keep a list of pages that we have sent back recently so that we
 * can avoid re-sending pages that the client will already have. E.g., the
 * client promises to hold the last 10 pages from any given segment for at least
 * N seconds. If the client did not hold onto the page, then they can send
 * another request with an "Oops, I dropped that one" flag set.</li>
 * <li>Resolving a key for a clustered index requires (a) resolving the
 * clustered index using its int64 identifier per above; and (b) traversing the
 * index. Traversing the index means resolving a whole bunch of int64
 * identifiers. <em>Ideally</em> those identifiers have great locality and we
 * can do lots of in process hits on a segment by sending the find() request to
 * the segment containing the index root.</li>
 * <li>Transactions are distributed. A PREPARE must be sent to all segments on
 * which the client has written, all segments must validate, etc., and all
 * responses must be returned to the client. When all segments have responded,
 * the client can commit. (A transaction that does not write can send abort
 * notices - it still needs to wait for an acknowledgement in order to have a
 * robust notice of the abort. Transactions probably need to send heartbeats so
 * that they can be presumptively killed if they stop working.) </li>
 * <li> Replicating segments should be part of how they are written and failover
 * to an existing replication is very cheap. However, splitting a segment could
 * be relatively expensive.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * FIXME Expand on latency and decision criteria for notifying clients when
 * pages or objects of interest have been modified by another transaction that
 * has committed (or in the case of distributed workers on a single transaction,
 * its peers).
 * 
 * FIXME Expand on the expected cost of finding a key or key range in a
 * clustered index, and on growth, splitting, migration, merging, and rebuilding
 * of key ranges for a clustered index as part of the above. It is absolutely
 * essential that the total cost of clustered index operations remains efficient
 * in the distributed database, that clustered indices can be readily (in terms
 * of transaction isolation) and efficiently (in terms of cost) split into and
 * old and a new segment (this may presume binary copy, which we don't really
 * support!). The tool that we have to work with is the journal, which can
 * absorb writes while we split the segment. However it MAY be MUCH easier to
 * manage this when the native segment model is a key range rather than int64
 * OIDs.
 * 
 * FIXME The disk writes are not being verified for the "direct" mode since we
 * are not testing restart and the journal is reading from an in-memory image.
 * 
 * FIXME Stress tests that cause the journal to wrap several times. Also tests
 * of extension, compaction, and truncation of the journal. A test that causes
 * wrapping needs to mix writes and deletes or the journal will run out of space
 * (running out of space should trigger extension). Compaction may require re-
 * copy of committed transactions and MUST NOT cause fragmentation. Compaction
 * makes sense when large swathes of the journal have been released, e.g., due
 * to data migration or overwrite. However, note that overwrite tends to cause
 * spotty release of slots rather than releasing entire ranges written by some
 * transaction.
 * 
 * FIXME The notion of a committed state needs to be captured by a persistent
 * structure in the journal until (a) there are no longer any active
 * transactions that can read from that committed state; and (b) the slots
 * allocated to that committed state have been released on the journal. Those
 * commit states need to be locatable on the journal, suggesting a record
 * written by PREPARE and finalized by COMMIT.
 * 
 * @todo Do we need to explicitly zero the allocated buffers? Are they already
 *       zeroed? How much do we actually need to write on them before the rest
 *       of the contents do not matter, e.g., just the root blocks?
 * 
 * @todo Work out protocol for shutdown with the single-threaded journal server.
 * 
 * @todo Normal transaction operations need to be interleaved with operations to
 *       migrate committed data to the read-optimized database; with operations
 *       to logically delete data versions (and their slots) on the journal once
 *       those version are no longer readable by any active transaction; and
 *       with operations to compact the journal (extending can occur during
 *       normal transaction operations). One approach is to implement
 *       thread-checking using thread local variables or the ability to assign
 *       the journal to a thread and then hand off the journal to the thread for
 *       the activity that needs to be run, returning control to the normal
 *       transaction thread on (or shortly after) interrupt or when the
 *       operation is finished.
 * 
 * @todo There is a dependency in a distributed database architecture on
 *       transaction begin time. A very long running transaction could force the
 *       journal to hold onto historical states. If a decision is made to
 *       discard those states and the transaction begins to read from the
 *       journal then the transaction must be rolled back.
 * 
 * @todo Define distributed transaction protocol.
 * 
 * @todo Define distributed protocol for robust startup, operation, and
 *       failover.
 * 
 * @todo Divide into API layers. The network facing layer uses a single threaded
 *       nio interface to receive writes into direct buffers. Writes on the
 *       journal are also single-threaded. Buffers of rows are queued by one
 *       thread and then written through to the journal by another. Isolation
 *       occurs in a layer above raw journal writes that maintains the object
 *       and allocation indices. Rows can be written onto slots using simple
 *       math since both the row size and the slot size are known. Objects must
 *       be deserialized during state-based validation if a conflict is
 *       detected.
 * 
 * @todo Flushing to disk on commit could be optional, e.g., if there are
 *       redundent journals then this is not required.
 * 
 * @todo cache objects? They are materialized only for state-based validation.
 *       If possible, validation should occur in its own layer so that the basic
 *       store can handle IO using either byte[] or streams (allocated from a
 *       high concurrency queue to minimize stream creation overhead).
 * 
 * @todo Add feature to return the transient journal buffer so that we can do
 *       interesting things with it, including write it to disk with the
 *       appropriate file header and root blocks so that it becomes restartable.
 * 
 * FIXME Implement a read only transaction and write test suites for its
 * semantics, including both the inability to write (or delete) on the
 * transaction, the handling of pre-existing versions, and the non-duplication
 * of per-tx data structures.
 * 
 * FIXME Write test suites for the {@link TransactionServer}.
 * 
 * FIXME Write a test that performs an index split. This is one of the remaining
 * tricky issues and I want to work it through in more depth. Binary copy of the
 * index rows will not work since they refer to one another by int64 id, and
 * those ids are linked to the segment. It is acceptable for the split to be
 * moderately costly as long as it has low / no apparent latency to bigdata
 * clients. For example, we could do a split based on a binary copy and an
 * temporary (mutual) id mapping for the old and new segment and then fixup the
 * rows in the background. Another alterative is an index specific segment
 * structure that models a keyrange as sorted data on disk, i.e., the rows are
 * arranged in sorted order. As far as I can tell, these become the same thing
 * when a row is an index node is a sufficiently large page.
 * 
 * FIXME I've been considering the problem of a distributed index more. A
 * mutiplexed journal holding segments for one or more clustered indices
 * (containing anything from database rows to generic objects to terms to
 * triples) would provide fast write absorption and good read rates without a
 * secondary read-optimized segment. If this is combined with pipelined journals
 * for per-index segment redundency (a given segment is replicated on N=3+
 * hosts) then we can have both failover and load-balancing for read-intensive
 * segments.
 * 
 * Clustered indices support (re-)distribution and redundency since their rows
 * are their essential data while the index simply provides efficient access.
 * Therefore the same objects may be written onto multiple replications of an
 * index range hosted by different journals. The object data will remain
 * invariant, but the entailed index data will be different for each journal on
 * which the object is written.
 * 
 * This requires a variety of metadata for each index segment. If a segment is
 * defined by an index identifier and a separator key, then the metadata model
 * needs to identify the master journal for a given segment (writes are directed
 * to this journal) and the secondary journals for the segment (the master
 * writes through to the secondary journals using a pipeline). Likewise, the
 * journal must be able to identify the root for any given committed state of
 * each index range written on that journal.
 * 
 * We need to track write load and read load per index range in the journal, per
 * journal, per IO channel, per disk, per host, and per network segment. Write
 * load can be reduced by splitting a segment, by using a host with faster
 * resources, or by reducing other utilization of the host. The latter would
 * include the case of preferring reads from a secondary journal for that index
 * segment. It is an extremely cheap action to offload readers to a secondary
 * service. Likewise, failover of the master for an index range is also
 * inexpensive since the data are already in place on several secondaries,
 * 
 * A new replication of an index range may be built up gradually, e.g., by
 * moving a leaf at a time and piplining only the sub-range of the index range
 * that has been already mirrored. For simplicity, the new copy of the index
 * range would not be visible in the index metadata until a full copy of the
 * index range was life. Registration of the copy with the metadata index is
 * then trivial. Until that time, the metadata index would only know that a copy
 * was being developed. If one of the existing replicas is not heavily loaded
 * then it can handle the creation of the new copy.
 * 
 * The nut to crack is that if the journal exceeds the capacity to readily
 * buffer directly, then we are faced with the prospect of having the index
 * nodes scattered over the disk with poor locality. This makes it a relatively
 * expensive operation to clone part of an index. In contrast, if we can fully
 * buffer a journal during this operation then we face one large sequential read
 * followed by sustained (network or disk) IO (depending on where we are
 * extracting the index range).
 * 
 * We need an efficient means to allocate storage within the journal extent.
 * This is linked to the issue of deallocation of inaccessible historical
 * versions and load balancing. If load balancing is handled by rollover to an
 * existing replication of an index range, then load balancing is a very fast
 * action.
 * 
 * One alternative is to freeze the journal every ~200M and start a new one (or
 * alternatively to reuse the same journal segment by logically releasing slots
 * as historical data versions are no longer accessible to readers). With this
 * approach the journal could be treated as a WORM store and allocation would be
 * optimized (next free N bytes, so we don't even need to use slots). In this
 * model we would use small index (order 64) nodes in the journal (since it is
 * fully buffered IO is not a problem and this minimizes the cost of inserts and
 * deletions). Either once the journal is frozen or periodically during its life
 * we would evict an index to a perfect index segment on disk (write the leaves
 * out in a linear sequence, complete with prior-next references, and build up a
 * perfect index over those leaves - the branching factor here can be much
 * higher in order to reduce the tree depth and optimize IO). The perfect index
 * would have to have "delete" entries to mark deleted keys. Periodically we
 * would merge evicted index segments. The goal is to balance write absorbtion
 * and concurrency control within memory and using pure sequantial IO against
 * 100:1 or better data on disk with random seeks for reading any given leaf.
 * The index nodes would be written densely after the leaves such that it would
 * be possible to fully buffer the index nodes with a single sequential IO. A
 * key range scan would likewise be a sequential IO since we would know the
 * start and end leaf for the key range directly from the index. A read would
 * first resolve against the current journal, then the prior journal iff one is
 * in the process of be paritioned out into individual perfect index segments,
 * and then against those index segments in order. A "point" read would
 * therefore be biased to be more efficient for "recently" written data, but
 * reads otherwise must present a merged view of the data in each remaining
 * historical perfect index that covers at least part of the key range.
 * Periodically the index segments could be fully merged, at which point we
 * would no longer have any delete entries in a given perfect index segment.
 * 
 * At one extreme there will be one journal per disk and the journal will use
 * the entire disk partition. In a pure write scenario the disk would perform
 * only sequential IO. However, applications will also need to read data from
 * disk. Read and write buffers need to be split. Write buffers are used to
 * defer IOs until large sequential IOs may be realized. Read buffers are used
 * for pre-fetching when the data on disk is much larger than the available RAM
 * and the expectation of reuse is low while the expectation of completing a
 * sequential scan is high. Direct buffering may be used for hot-spots but
 * requires a means to bound the locality of the buffered segment, e.g., by not
 * multiplexing an index segment that will be directly buffered and providing a
 * sufficient resource abundence for high performance.
 * 
 * @todo I need to revisit the assumptions for very large objects in the face of
 *       the recent / planned redesign. I expect that using an index with a key
 *       formed as [URI][chuck#] would work just fine. Chunks would then be
 *       limited to 32k or so.

    // // * </p>

    // /*
    // * FIXME Implement garbage collection of overwritten and unreachable
    // * versions. Without migration to a read-optimized database, GC by
    // * itself is NOT sufficient to allow us to deallocate versions that have
    // * NOT been overwritten and hence is NOT sufficient to allow us to
    // * discard historical transactions in their entirety.
    // *
    // * Given a transaction Tn that overwrites one or more pre-existing
    // * versions, the criteria for deallocation of the overwritten versions
    // * are:
    // *
    // * (A) Tn commits, hence its intention has been made persistent; and
    // *
    // * (B) There are no active transactions remaining that started from a
    // * committed state before the commit state resulting from Tn, hence the
    // * versions overwritten by Tn are not visible to any active transaction.
    // * Any new transaction will read through the committed state produced by
    // * Tn and will perceive the new versions rather than the overwritten
    // * versions.
    // *
    // * Therefore, once Tn commits (assuming it has overwritten at least one
    // * pre-existing version), we can add each concurrent transaction Ti that
    // * is still active when Tn commits to a set of transactions that must
    // * either validate or abort before we may GC(Tn). Since Tn has committed
    // * it is not possible for new transactions to be created that would have
    // * to be included in this set since any new transaction would start from
    // * the committed state of Tn or its successors in the serialization
    // * order. As transactions validate or abort they are removed from
    // * GC(Tn). When this set is empty, we garbage collect the pre-existing
    // * versions that were overwritten by Tn.
    // *
    // * The sets GC(T) must be restart safe. Changes to the set can only
    // * occur when a transaction commits or aborts. However, even the abort
    // * of a transaction MUST be noticable on restart.
    // *
    // * A summary may be used that is the highest transaction timestamp for
    // * which Tn must wait before running GC(Tn). That can be written once
    // *
    // *
    // * Note that multiple transactions may have committed, so we may find
    // * that Tn has successors in the commit/serialization order that also
    // * meet the above criteria. All such committed transactions may be
    // * processed at once, but they MUST be processed in their commit order.
    // *
    // * Once those pre-conditions have been met the following algorithm is
    // * applied to GC the historical versions that were overwritten by Tn:
    // *
    // * 1. For each write by Ti where n < i <= m that overwrote a historical
    // * version, deallocate the slots for that historical version. This is
    // * valid since there are no active transactions that can read from that
    // * historical state. The processing order for Ti probably does not
    // * matter, but in practice there may be a reason to choose the
    // * serialization or reverse serialization order
    // *
    // * ---- this is getting closed but is not yet correct ----
    // *
    // * All versions written by a given transaction have the timestamp of
    // * that transaction.
    // *
    // * The committed transactions are linked by their commit records into a
    // * reverse serialization sequence.
    // *
    // * Each committed transaction has an object index that is accessible
    // * from its commit record. The entries in this index are versions that
    // * were written (or deleted) by that transaction. This index reads
    // * through into the object index for the committed state of the journal
    // * from which the transaction was minted.
    // *
    // * We could maintain in the entry information about the historical
    // * version that was overwritten. For example, its firstSlot or a run
    // * length encoding of the slots allocated to the historical version.
    // *
    // * We could maintain an index for all overwritten versions from
    // * [timestamp + dataId] to [slotId] (or a run-length encoding of the
    // * slots on which the version was written). Given a timestamp, we would
    // * then do a key scan from the start of the index for all entries whose
    // * timestamp was less than or equal to the given timestamp. For each
    // * such entry, we would deallocate the version and delete the entry from
    // * the index.
    // *
    // * tx0 : begin tx0 : write id0 (v0) tx0 : commit journal : deallocate <=
    // * tx0 (NOP since no overwritten versions)

    // * tx1 : begin tx2 : begin tx1 : write id0 (v1) tx1 : commit journal :
    // * deallocate <= tx1 (MUST NOT BE GENERATED since dependencies exist :
