/**
 * <p>
 * An object journal for very fast write absorbtion. The journal supports
 * concurrent fully isolated transactions and is designed to absorb writes
 * destined for a read-optimized database file. Writes are logically appended to
 * the journal to minimize disk head movement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The journal provides for fast migration of committed data to a read-optimized
 * database. Data may be migrated as soon as a transaction commits and only the
 * most recent state for any datum need be migrated. Note that the criteria for
 * migration typically are met before the slots occupied by those objects may be
 * released. This is because a concurrent transaction must be permitted to read
 * from the committed state of the database at the time that the transaction was
 * begun.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The journal is a ring buffer divised of slots. The slot size and initial
 * extent are specified when the journal is provisioned. Objects are written
 * onto free slots. Slots are released once no active transaction can read from
 * that slots. In this way, the journal buffers consistent histories.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The journal maintains two indices:
 * <ol>
 * <li>An object index from int32 object identifier to a slot allocation; and
 * </li>
 * <li>An allocation index from slot to a slot status record.</li>
 * </ol>
 * These data structures are b+trees. The nodes of the btrees are stored in the
 * journal. These data structures are fully isolated. The roots of the indices
 * are choosen based on the transaction begin time. Changes result in a copy on
 * write. Writes percolate up the index nodes to the root node.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Commit processing. The journal also maintains two root blocks. When the
 * journal is wired into memory, incremental writes are absorbed by the journal
 * into a direct buffer and written through to disk. Writes are flushed to disk
 * on commit. Commit processing also updates the root blocks using the Challis
 * algorithm. (The root blocks are updated using an alternating pattern and
 * timestamps are recorded at the head and tail of each root block to detect
 * partial writes.)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A journal may be used without a database file as an object database. The
 * design is very efficient for absorbing writes, but read operations are not
 * optimized. Overall performance will degrade as the journal size increases
 * beyond the limits of physical memory and as the object index depth increases.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A journal and a database file form a logical segment in the bigdata
 * distributed database architecture. In bigdata, the segment size is generally
 * limited to a few hundred megabytes. At this scale, the journal and database
 * may both be wired into memory for the fastest performance. If memory
 * constraits are tighted, these files may be memory-mapped or used as a
 * disk-base data structures. A single journal may buffer for multiple copies of
 * the same database segment or journals may be chained for redundancy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Very large objects should be handled by specially provisioned database files
 * using large pages and a "never overwrite" strategy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This class is NOT thread-safe. Instances of this class MUST use a
 * single-threaded context. That context is the single-threaded journal server
 * API. The journal server may be either embedded (in which case objects are
 * migrated to the server using FIFO queues) or networked (in which case the
 * journal server exposes a non-blocking service with a single thread for reads,
 * writes and deletes on the journal).

 * FIXME Priority items are:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Segment server (mixture of journal server and read-optimized database
 * server).</li>
 * <li> Persistence capable data structures for the object index (basically, a
 * btree) and the allocation indices. The allocation index is less clear, but a
 * BitSet will do until I settle on something better - one of the tricks no
 * matter how you approach it is getting closure on the self-referential issue
 * with slots and a slot allocation index; maybe the per-tx data structure is
 * just transient will the committed data structure is persistent?</li>
 * <li> Transaction isolation. (Also, will there be a "non-transactional mode"?)
 * The API in {@link Journal} should probably be modified to use "Tx" objects
 * rather than just long ids for transactions.</li>
 * <li> Commit protocol, including plan for PREPARE in support of distributed
 * transactions.</li>
 * <li> Migration of data to a read-optimized database (have to implement the
 * read-optimized database as well).</li>
 * <li>Support primary key indices in GPO/PO layer.</li>
 * <li>Implement forward validation and state-based conflict resolution with
 * custom merge rules for persistent objects, generic objects, and primary key
 * indices, and secondary indexes.</li>
 * <li> Architecture using queues from GOM to journal/database segment server
 * supporting both embedded and remote scenarios.</li>
 * <li> Distributed database protocols.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * FIXME Document the sources of latency and stages of identifer resolution for
 * bigdata
 * <ul>
 * <li>Transaction identifiers must be generated by a central source, which is
 * a source of latency.</li>
 * <li>A client must resolve each new segment identifer a service on a host. If
 * the segment is moved, the client must be notified or rediscover the location
 * of the segment (service and host) (multiple services on a host to let us
 * access all RAM using Java)</li>
 * <li>A segment identifier is resolved to a journal and database extent by a
 * service using an in-memory hash table.</li>
 * <li>An int32 identifier must be resolved against the journal first, if there
 * is a journal for that segment. If the journal is fully buffered, then this
 * will have low latency. Otherwise, we need a mixture of per-transaction hash
 * table (fast hits on data versions written within that transaction), an object
 * index with a high branch factor (fast access times to historical versions on
 * the journal) and perhaps a bloom filter in front of the persistent global
 * object index (weeds out most misses and transactional isolation has already
 * been handled). </li>
 * <li>A miss on the journal requires a read on the database segment. The
 * database uses a direct mapping of the int32 identifier to a logical page. The
 * logical page is a real page. The row on the page is found using a slot map.
 * If the logical page overflows, then some rows will be moved onto continuation
 * page(s). This means ONE(1) disk access (without cache hits) in the common
 * case, but overflow can result in chasing a page chain. If overflow proves
 * common, then we could list the continuation pages directly so that there was
 * never more than TWO (2) disk accesses to retrieve a page. We always read a
 * page at a time on the database and send back the entire page to the client.
 * We need to keep a list of pages that we have sent back recently so that we
 * can avoid re-sending pages that the client will already have. E.g., the
 * client promises to hold the last 10 pages from any given segment for at least
 * N seconds. If the client did not hold onto the page, then they can send
 * another request with an "Oops, I dropped that one" flag set.</li>
 * <li>Resolving a key for a clustered index requires (a) resolving the
 * clustered index using its int64 identifier per above; and (b) traversing the
 * index. Traversing the index means resolving a whole bunch of int64
 * identifiers. <em>Ideally</em> those identifiers have great locality and we
 * can do lots of in process hits on a segment by sending the find() request to
 * the segment containing the index root.</li>
 * <li>Transactions are distributed. A PREPARE must be sent to all segments on
 * which the client has written, all segments must validate, etc., and all
 * responses must be returned to the client. When all segments have responded,
 * the client can commit. (A transaction that does not write can send abort
 * notices - it still needs to wait for an acknowledgement in order to have a
 * robust notice of the abort. Transactions probably need to send heartbeats so
 * that they can be presumptively killed if they stop working.) </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * FIXME Expand on latency and decision criteria for int64 assignments.
 * 
 * FIXME Expand on latency and decision criteria for notifying clients when
 * pages or objects of interest have been modified by another transaction that
 * has committed (or in the case of distributed workers on a single transaction,
 * its peers).
 * 
 * FIXME Expand on the expected cost of finding a key or key range in a
 * clustered index, and on growth, splitting, migration, merging, and rebuilding
 * of key ranges for a clustered index as part of the above. It is absolutely
 * essential that the total cost of clustered index operations remains efficient
 * in the distributed database, that clustered indices can be readily (in terms
 * of transaction isolation) and efficient (in terms of cost) split into and old
 * and a new segment (this may presume binary copy, which we don't really
 * support!). The tool that we have to work with is the journal, which can
 * absorb writes while we split the segment. However it MAY be MUCH easier to
 * manage this when the native segment model is a key range rather than int64
 * OIDs.
 * 
 * FIXME Does the Journal need to have a concept of "named root objects?" How is
 * that concept supported by bigdata? Per segment? Overall? Both?
 * 
 * FIXME Explore use of bloom filters in front of segments. How does this
 * interact with transaction isolation?
 * 
 * FIXME The disk writes are not being verified for the "direct" mode since we
 * are not testing restart and the journal is reading from an in-memory image.
 * 
 * FIXME Stress tests that cause the journal to wrap several times. Also tests
 * of extension, compaction, and truncation of the journal. A test that causes
 * wrapping needs to mix writes and deletes or the journal will run out of space
 * (running out of space should trigger extension).
 * 
 * FIXME Migration of data to the read-optimized database means that the current
 * committed version is on the database. However, subsequent migration of
 * another version of the same data item can require the re-introduction of a
 * mapping into the object index IFF there are active transactions that can read
 * the now historical data version. This suggests that migration probably should
 * not remove the entry from the object index, but rather flag that the current
 * version is on the database. That flag can be cleared when the version is
 * replaced. This also suggests efficient lookup of prior versions is required.
 * 
 * FIXME The notion of a committed state needs to be captured by a persistent
 * structure in the journal until (a) there are no longer any active
 * transactions that can read from that committed state; and (b) the slots
 * allocated to that committed state have been released on the journal. Those
 * commit states need to be locatable on the journal, suggesting a record
 * written by PREPARE and finalized by COMMIT.
 * 
 * @todo Do we need to explicitly zero the allocated buffers? Are they already
 *       zeroed? How much do we actually need to write on them before the rest
 *       of the contents do not matter, e.g., just the root blocks?
 * 
 * @todo Work out protocol for shutdown with the single-threaded journal server.
 * 
 * @todo Normal transaction operations need to be interleaved with operations to
 *       migrate committed data to the read-optimized database; with operations
 *       to logically delete data versions (and their slots) on the journal once
 *       those version are no longer readable by any active transaction; and
 *       with operations to compact the journal (extending can occur during
 *       normal transaction operations). One approach is to implement
 *       thread-checking using thread local variables or the ability to assign
 *       the journal to a thread and then hand off the journal to the thread for
 *       the activity that needs to be run, returning control to the normal
 *       transaction thread on (or shortly after) interrupt or when the
 *       operation is finished.
 * 
 * @todo There is a dependency in a distributed database architecture on
 *       transaction begin time. A very long running transaction could force the
 *       journal to hold onto historical states. If a decision is made to
 *       discard those states and the transaction begins to read from the
 *       journal then the transaction must be rolled back.
 * 
 * @todo Define distributed transaction protocol.
 * 
 * @todo Define distributed protocol for robust startup, operation, and
 *       failover.
 * 
 * @todo Divide into API layers. The network facing layer uses a single threaded
 *       nio interface to receive writes into direct buffers. Writes on the
 *       journal are also single-threaded. Buffers of rows are queued by one
 *       thread and then written through to the journal by another. Isolation
 *       occurs in a layer above raw journal writes that maintains the object
 *       and allocation indices. Rows can be written onto slots using simple
 *       math since both the row size and the slot size are known. Objects must
 *       be deserialized during state-based validation if a conflict is
 *       detected.
 * 
 * @todo Refactor btree support for journals.
 * 
 * @todo Flushing to disk on commit could be optional, e.g., if there are
 *       redundent journals then this is not required.
 * 
 * @todo cache index and allocation nodes regardless of the strategy since those
 *       are materialized objects.
 * 
 * @todo cache objects? They are materialized only for state-based validation.
 *       If possible, validation should occur in its own layer so that the basic
 *       store can handle IO using either byte[] or streams (allocated from a
 *       high concurrency queue to minimize stream creation overhead).

     * @todo Document that tx==null implies NO isolation and modify / partition
     *       the test suite to handle both unisolated and isolated testing. The
     *       semantics on read are that you can read anything that was visible
     *       as of the last committed state (but nothing written in any still
     *       active transaction) - and unlike a transactionally isolated read,
     *       each read operation is reads against the then-current last
     *       committed state.<br>
     *       The semantics on write is that the object data version is replaced.
     *       Unless the 'native transaction counter' is positive, a commit will
     *       take place immediately.<br>
     *       The semantics on delete are just like on write (delete is just a
     *       special case of write, even though it generally gets optimized
     *       quite a bit and triggers various cleaning behaviors).

     * <li> A version that was written within transaction is being overwritten
     * in the same transaction. In this case, the slots allocated to the

     * version is no longer visible in any scope. This case is detected and
     * handled by {@link #write(Tx, int, ByteBuffer)}.</li>
     * 
     * <li> The last transaction that is capable of reading versions from a
     * historical committed state on the journal has completed processing (it
     * has either prepared or aborted and in any case will no longer read data
     * versions). Once notice of that event is received by the journal, the
     * journal can release the slots allocated to the committed version of any
     * data written by that transaction (or by any earlier transaction). There
     * are actually two cases here: one in which the data version was deleted,
     * one in which it was subsequently overwritten. (A pre-condition is that
     * the committed state of transactions is migrated in a timely manner onto
     * the read-optimized database such that the last committed version of any
     * data version that has not subsequently been overwritten is on the
     * database, otherwise deleting the versions for that transaction would
     * result in unrecoverable loss of those versions.)</li>
     * 
     * </ul>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note: Just because a data version has been migrated onto the
     * read-optimized database does NOT mean that its slots may be deleted on
     * the journal. This is because subsequent committed versions will overwrite
     * the version on the database. The overwritten version MUST remain on the
     * journal until it is no longer visible to any active transaction.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note: Regardless of the reason why the slots are being deallocated, the
     * <em>caller</em> has the responsibility to clean up the object index
     * metadata such that the deallocated slots are no longer mapped to the
     * version. This is easy in the case of within-transaction overwrite of data
     * versions. Likewise, the object index for the transaction can simply be
     * discarded when releasing slots for an entire transaction.
