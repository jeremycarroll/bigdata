/**
 * <p>
 * An append-only persistence capable data structure supporting atomic commit,
 * scalable named indices, and transactions. Writes are logically appended to
 * the journal to minimize disk head movement.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The journal provides for fast migration of committed data to a read-optimized
 * database. Data may be migrated as soon as a transaction commits and only the
 * most recent state for any datum need be migrated. Note that the criteria for
 * migration typically are met before the slots occupied by those objects may be
 * released. This is because a concurrent transaction must be permitted to read
 * from the committed state of the database at the time that the transaction was
 * begun.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The journal is a ring buffer divised of slots. The slot size and initial
 * extent are specified when the journal is provisioned. Objects are written
 * onto free slots. Slots are released once no active transaction can read from
 * that slots. In this way, the journal buffers consistent histories.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The journal maintains two indices:
 * <ol>
 * <li>An object index from int32 object identifier to a slot allocation; and
 * </li>
 * <li>An allocation index from slot to a slot status record.</li>
 * </ol>
 * These data structures are b+trees. The nodes of the btrees are stored in the
 * journal. These data structures are fully isolated. The roots of the indices
 * are choosen based on the transaction begin time. Changes result in a copy on
 * write. Writes percolate up the index nodes to the root node.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Commit processing. The journal also maintains two root blocks. Commit updates
 * the root blocks using the Challis algorithm. (The root blocks are updated
 * using an alternating pattern and timestamps are recorded at the head and tail
 * of each root block to detect partial writes.) When the journal is backed by a
 * disk file, the file is flushed to disk on commit.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A journal may be used without a database file as an object database. The
 * design is very efficient for absorbing writes, but read operations are not
 * optimized. Overall performance will degrade as the journal size increases
 * beyond the limits of physical memory and as the object index depth increases.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A journal and a database file form a logical segment in the bigdata
 * distributed database architecture. In bigdata, the segment size is generally
 * limited to a few hundred megabytes. At this scale, the journal and database
 * may both be wired into memory for the fastest performance. If memory
 * constraits are tighted, these files may be memory-mapped or used as a
 * disk-base data structures. A single journal may buffer for multiple copies of
 * the same database segment or journals may be chained for redundancy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Very large objects should be handled by specially provisioned database files
 * using large pages and a "never overwrite" strategy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This class is NOT thread-safe. Instances of this class MUST use a
 * single-threaded context. That context is the single-threaded journal server
 * API. The journal server may be either embedded (in which case objects are
 * migrated to the server using FIFO queues) or networked (in which case the
 * journal server exposes a non-blocking service with a single thread for reads,
 * writes and deletes on the journal). (However, note transaction processing MAY
 * be concurrent since the write set of a transaction is written on a
 * {@link TemporaryStore}.)
 * </p>

 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * FIXME Priority items are:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Transaction isolation.</li>
 * <li> Scale out database (automatic re-partitioning of indices).</li>
 * <li> Distributed database protocols.</li>
 * <li> Segment server (mixture of journal server and read-optimized database
 * server).</li>
 * <li> Testing of an "embedded database" using both a journal only and a
 * journal + read-optimized database design. This can be tested up to the GPO
 * layer.</li>
 * <li>Support primary key (clustered) indices in GPO/PO layer.</li>
 * <li>Implement backward validation and state-based conflict resolution with
 * custom merge rules for RDFS, persistent objects, generic objects, and primary
 * key indices, and secondary indexes.</li>
 * <li> Architecture using queues from GOM to journal/database segment server
 * supporting both embedded and remote scenarios.</li>
 * <li>Expand on latency and decision criteria for notifying clients when pages
 * or objects of interest have been modified by another transaction that has
 * committed (or in the case of distributed workers on a single transaction, its
 * peers).</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * FIXME The notion of a committed state needs to be captured by a persistent
 * structure in the journal until (a) there are no longer any active
 * transactions that can read from that committed state; and (b) the slots
 * allocated to that committed state have been released on the journal. Those
 * commit states need to be locatable on the journal, suggesting a record
 * written by PREPARE and finalized by COMMIT.
 * 
 * @todo Work out protocol for shutdown with the single-threaded journal server.
 * 
 * @todo Normal transaction operations need to be interleaved with operations to
 *       migrate committed data to the read-optimized database; with operations
 *       to logically delete data versions (and their slots) on the journal once
 *       those version are no longer readable by any active transaction; and
 *       with operations to compact the journal (extending can occur during
 *       normal transaction operations). One approach is to implement
 *       thread-checking using thread local variables or the ability to assign
 *       the journal to a thread and then hand off the journal to the thread for
 *       the activity that needs to be run, returning control to the normal
 *       transaction thread on (or shortly after) interrupt or when the
 *       operation is finished.
 * 
 * @todo There is a dependency in a distributed database architecture on
 *       transaction begin time. A very long running transaction could force the
 *       journal to hold onto historical states. If a decision is made to
 *       discard those states and the transaction begins to read from the
 *       journal then the transaction must be rolled back. This should be worked
 *       out with the resource deallocation for old journals and segments.
 * 
 * @todo Define distributed transaction protocol.
 * 
 * @todo Define distributed protocol for robust startup, operation, and
 *       failover.
 * 
 * @todo Divide into API layers. The network facing layer uses a single threaded
 *       nio interface to receive writes into direct buffers. Writes on the
 *       journal are also single-threaded. Buffers of rows are queued by one
 *       thread and then written through to the journal by another. Isolation
 *       occurs in a layer above raw journal writes that maintains the object
 *       and allocation indices. Rows can be written onto slots using simple
 *       math since both the row size and the slot size are known. Objects must
 *       be deserialized during state-based validation if a conflict is
 *       detected.
 * 
 * FIXME Write tests for writable and read-only fully isolated transactions,
 * including the non-duplication of per-tx data structures (e.g., you always get
 * the same object back when you ask for an isolated named index).
 * 
 * FIXME Write test suites for the {@link TransactionServer}.
 * 
 * @todo I need to revisit the assumptions for very large objects in the face of
 *       the recent / planned redesign. I expect that using an index with a key
 *       formed as [URI][chuck#] would work just fine. Chunks would then be
 *       limited to 32k or so. Writes on such indices should probably be
 *       directed to a journal using a disk-only mode.
