/**
 * Abstract base class for tasks that may be submitted to the
 * {@link ConcurrentJournal}. Tasks may be isolated (by a transaction) or
 * unisolated. Tasks access named resources (aka indices), which they
 * pre-declare in their constructors.
 * <p>
 * Isolated tasks are part of a larger transaction. Transactions are started and
 * committed using an {@link ITransactionManager}. Several kinds of isolation
 * are supported - see {@link IsolationEnum}. Transactional tasks run with full
 * concurrency using an MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) strategy. When
 * a transaction is committed (by the {@link ITransactionManager}) it must wait
 * for lock(s) on the unisolated named indices on which it has written before it
 * may validate and commit.
 * <p>
 * Unisolated tasks are further divided into read only and read/write. A
 * read-only task reads against the last committed state of a named index.
 * Concurrent unisolated readers are permitted without locking on the same
 * index.
 * <p>
 * A read/write task reads and writes on the "live" index. Note that only a
 * single thread may write on a {@link BTree} at a time. Therefore read/write
 * tasks (often referred to as writers) obtain an exclusive lock on the named
 * index(s). When more than one named index is used, the locks are used to infer
 * a partial ordering of the writers allowing as much concurrency as possible.
 * Pre-declaration of locks allows us to avoid deadlocks in the lock system.
 * 
 * FIXME In order to allow concurrent tasks to do work on the same transaction
 * we need to use a per-transaction {@link LockManager} to produce a partial
 * order that governs access to the isolated (vs mutable unisolated) indices
 * accessed by that transaction.
 * <p>
 * Make sure that the {@link TemporaryStore} supports an appropriate level of
 * concurrency to allow concurrent writers on distinct isolated indices that are
 * being buffered on that store for a given transaction.
 * 
 * @todo Should it be possible to start/commit/abort a transaction from within
 *       an {@link AbstractIndexTask}? Only on the local journal? When the
 *       transaction manager is distributed? (I think not, certainly not when
 *       the tx is distributed and there is no need to handle start/stop of a
 *       local tx in this manner since you can just use unisolated reads or
 *       writes instead and have atomicity.)
 * 
 * @todo write a task design to support 1-phase commit (for a transaction that
 *       ran on a single journal) and 2/3-phase commit of transactions (for a
 *       transaction whose write sets are distributed across multiple journals).
