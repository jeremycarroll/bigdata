/**
 * The network facing interface for a journal file. The journal is used to
 * absorb pre-serialized objects and smaller streams (large streams should be
 * directed to a suitably provisioned read-write database segment, e.g., large
 * pages, large extents, and lots of disk). This means that objects appearing
 * from the network-facing interface of the journal already have an assigned
 * int64 identifier. This service identifies the target journal based on the
 * segment component of the identifier. What the journal does is allocate slots
 * to absorb those objects and update an object index so that they can be
 * recovered. The journal accepts int32 within segment persistent identifiers.
 * The internal addresses for the journal are slot identifiers, which are not
 * visible to the application.
