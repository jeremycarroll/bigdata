/**
 * An interface providing a read-only view of a commit record. A commit record
 * is written on each commit. The basic metadata in the commit record are the
 * root addresses from which various critical resources may be loaded, e.g.,
 * data structures for mapping index names to their addresses on the
 * {@link Journal}, etc. The {@link Journal} maintains an
 * {@link Journal#getCommitRecord()} index over the commits records so that
 * {@link Tx transactions} can rapidly recover the commit record corresponding
 * to their historical, read-only ground state.

 * @todo consider modifying to allow named root addresses for a small #of root
 *       names. E.g., an set of {name,addr} pairs that is either scanned as an
