/**
 * A service for sending raw {@link ByteBuffer}s across a socket. This service
 * supports the HA write pipeline. This service is designed to be paired with an
 * {@link HAReceiveService}, which typically is running on a different host. The
 * {@link HASendService} provides only an efficient raw data transfer. The HA
 * write pipeline coordinates the transfer of data using RMI messages which tell
 * the receiver how much data to expect, the checksum of the data, etc.
 * 
 * <h2>Implementation</h2>
 * 
 * This class has a private single-threaded Executor to which it submits a
 * {@link SendTask}. The {@link SendTask} will open a blocking-mode
 * {@link SocketChannel} to the service at the configured
 * {@link InetSocketAddress} and send the bytes remaining in a
 * {@link ByteBuffer} to that service on that {@link SocketChannel}. The data
 * will be sent on the socket using
 * {@link WritableByteChannel#write(ByteBuffer)}, which is optimized for the NIO
 * transfer of direct {@link ByteBuffer}s. Since this is a blocking-mode
 * connection, the write operation will block until all bytes have been sent or
 * the current thread is interrupted, e.g., by cancelling its Future.
 * <p>
 * The {@link SendTask} verifies that all bytes were sent as a post-condition
 * (position() == limit). If there is any problem, then the
 * {@link SocketChannel} is closed and the original exception is thrown out of
 * {@link SendTask#call()}. If the socket is closed from the other end while we
 * are still writing data, then that exception gets thrown out as well. The
 * socket connection is closed as a post-condition (it does not survive across
 * multiple sends). Closing the socket connection after each success or
 * unsuccessful send gives us a strong indication of success or failure for the
 * data transfer which is independent of the RMI message and makes it trivial to
 * re-synchronize the {@link HASendService} since it is basically stateless.
