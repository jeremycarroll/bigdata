/**
 * <p>
 * Interface for managing the free and allocated slots in a {@link Journal}.
 * Logically the slot allocation index is random access bit set with one bit for
 * each slot in the journal. The primary operations are getting or setting the
 * bit corresponding to a single slot and scanning for the next clear bit.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The journal is logically an append only data structure. Each data version
 * written on the journal fills the next N slots (depending on the length of the
 * data version) whose bits in the allocation index are clear. When data
 * versions are no longer readable by any active transaction, the slots on which
 * those versions were written are cleared. The {@link IObjectIndex} stores the
 * first slot on which a given data version was written. The per-slot header
 * stores a double-linked list of the prior and next slots. When the journal
 * overflows, it wraps around back to its head and continues to search for free
 * slots.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Slot allocation index operations tend to have good locality. Efficient
 * forward scans for the next clear slot must be supported. Scans must wrap
 * around and must not search further than necessary. Either the journal itself
 * or the slot allocation index MUST track the index of the
 * <em>next free slot</em> in the journal so that slots may be assigned
 * efficiently as data versions are written on the journal. In addition, the
 * slot allocation index should track the index of the <em>first free slot</em>
 * and the <em>last free slot</em> in order to bound scans for the next free
 * slot when a new slot must be allocated.
 * </p>
 * 
 * FIXME Modify Journal to use the distinction of allocated + committed (two
 * bits of state per slot).
 * 
 * FIXME Write a test suite for {@link ISlotAllocationIndex}.
 * 
 * @todo decide on requirements for incremental or all at once storage.
 *       incremental storage would break down the slot allocation index into
 *       chunks and write only those chunks that are dirty (as part of the
 *       commit protocol). incremental storage therefore needs a mechanism to
 *       decide which chunks and in what order form the total slot allocation
 *       index. This could be done with slot header that chain together smaller
 *       bit sets stored as slot data (a persistence capable linked list) or as
 *       some sort of a tree or hash map data structure. The slot allocation
 *       index should be wired into a memory on restart or simply cached as we
 *       go, but should also write through to disk. If we store each bit set
 *       chunk as a single slot, then it seems likely that we can avoid any
 *       recursion problems.
 * 
 * @todo decide on whether we need to store one version of the slot allocation
 *       index; one per tx; tx isolated changes that get merged; or two versions -
 *       one for each of the root blocks. <br>
 *       The global context MUST be consistent with the allocations made across
 *       all active and committed transactions. This can be achieved either by
 *       marking the change in a global bit set and then backing it out on abort
 *       (undo log); by testing the global index and then all per-tx indices if
 *       there is a miss in the global index (this seems very inefficient given
 *       the need for both fast bit test and fast scan for the next free bit and
 *       the per-tx changes would have to be merged down onto the global index
 *       at commit);<br>
 *       The "undo log" handles isolation by keeping a record of the current set
 *       of slots that were allocated to a transaction. We already know the
 *       first slot in each current version from the object index. We could scan
 *       the data versions from each first slot to find the current set of slots
 *       allocated to the transaction, but this could be very slow in the disk
 *       only mode. The alternative is to record the current set of slots that
 *       were allocated within the transaction scope. (De-)allocations write
 *       through to the global index, including the special case when a data
 *       version overwrites a prior data version written earlier by the same
 *       transaction (and hence the prior version is no longer visible to any
 *       transaction and its slots are immediately deallocated). On any commit,
 *       dirty chunks of the global slot index are flushed (this implies that we
 *       can defer writes for the special case of the slots that code a chunk in
 *       the slot index) and the per-transaction slot index information is
 *       simply discarded. On abort, the slots allocated to the transaction are
 *       backed out of the global slot index, causing those slots to be marked
 *       as free. While both commit and abort are cheap, on restart there can be
 *       slots that appear to be allocated (since dirty chunks of the slot index
 *       map are always flushed) but which in fact do not contain any committed
 *       data - those slots would have to be discovered and released.<br>
 *       The above appears to be an efficient design except with regard to
 *       restart. Since restart is a relatively common event, even if it is
 *       restart from a clean shutdown, we must also optimize restart. On
 *       approach is to use two bits per slot. One bit codes whether the slot is
 *       allocated. The 2nd bit codes whether the allocation belongs to a
 *       committed transaction. On restart, we would then scan the slot index
 *       and deallocate any slots that were not marked as belonging to a
 *       committed transaction. This process should be extremely fast.<br>
 *       There is going to be an interesting problem bootstrapping the slot
 *       index. With a new store, we can simply allocate the first N slots to
 *       the index, where N is computed based on the initial extent and the #of
 *       slots that can be indexed by the data in a single slot (dataSize/4
 *       since we need two bits per slot). The allocations that comprise the
 *       slot index itself will in all likelyhood fit onto the first slot. Those
 *       slots can be marked as allocated and we can then execute a native
 *       commit, at which point the will be marked as allocated + committed and
 *       the dirty slot index chunks will be flushed to the disk. The store is
 *       now ready for use.<br>
 *       On restart, the head of the slot index chain is read from the
 *       appropriate root block. The chain is then read into an indexed
 *       transient data structure in order to (a) ensure that the slot
 *       allocation index is cached; and (b) provide fast random access to the
 *       chunks in the slot allocation index.<br>
 * 
 * @todo handle extension, which requires bootstrapping additional chunks for
 *       the slot index. Extension should be easy since we again have slots in
 *       the new extent that we know a-priori to be free. We stitch those slots
 *       into the chain, mark the slots allocated to the chain as allocated and
 *       do a native commit.<br>
 *       If performing a native commit during extension is undesirable, e.g.,
 *       because it would break serialization of transactions, then on restart
 *       we simply need to check the logical length of the slot index against
 *       the extent. If the logical length is less than the extent, then we need
 *       to bootstrap the chain for the new extent. This situation can only
 *       arise when the journal crashes before the first commit on the new
 *       extent.
 * 
 * @todo handle compaction in preparation for truncation. There are probably
 *       choices here. One choice is to ensure that we can release N slots
 *       starting at the head of the journal, where N is the length of the slot
 *       allocation chain. The chain is then bootstapped in its new location and
 *       the old chain is released. By handling the slot allocation chain first
 *       we can guarentee that other compaction operations will not effect any
 *       slot that is part of that chain. This is important since the chain is
 *       NOT recorded in the object index - it can only be discovered from the
 *       current root block.<br>
 *       Compaction probably requires a commit in order to write the new root
 *       block. Likewise, we can NOT truncate the journal until after we have
 *       performed a successful commit. Thus, once the journal is prepared for
 *       truncation, it needs to wait until after the next commit before
 *       actually chopping off the tail.<br>
 *       There is, of course, an edge case when the journal is empty. E.g., all
 *       data has been successfully migrated to the read-optimized database and
 *       no active transaction can read any historical versions on the journal.
 *       In this case, we can simple drop the journal.
 * 
 * @todo Commit processing requires that we mark all slots allocated by a given
 *       tx as committed. Currently, the outer object index holds the firstSlot
 *       for each chain of slots for an object. We have to actually examine that
 *       slot in order to determine whether there are more slots in the chain,
 *       and if there are then we have to chase the slot chain in order to find
 *       all of those slots. If the journal is buffered in memory then this will
 *       be very cheap. However, a memory-mapped or disk-based journal could
 *       show a significant performance hit.<br>
 *       One way to handle this would be to factor the slot header out of the
 *       slot and into the allocation index. The index would then have two bits
 *       plus two int32, for a total of 9 bytes per slot. This would make it
 *       much more pallatable to keep the slot chains in RAM, even for the
 *       disk-based journal. However, this still gets pretty bit for a 200M
 *       journal - and is probably too large for memory for a very large
 *       disk-based journal.<br>
 *       There is really no reason to have prior and next slot links in the slot
 *       header. The prior links provide for greater transparency in the journal
 *       since you can scan slot by slot and figure out where the object starts
 *       and where it ends and look it up in the various stable object indices.
 *       However, that seems like it may be too much cost for the benefit given
 *       the percentage of a slot that is dedicated to the slot header and given
 *       the size of a slot metadata array if the slot headers are re-factored
 *       into the slot allocation index. <br>
 *       Another way to deal with this is to have slots of differing sizes and
 *       slot allocation indices for each extent of slots of a given size.
 *       However, that does not nicely support an append only writer, which is a
 *       key requirement.
 * 
 * @todo If it is true that the allocations for entire transactions get released
 *       at once, then we can probably optimize deallocation simply by tracking
 *       the allocations made within a transaction using chunks of bit sets,
 *       much like the global allocation table but using only a single bit per
 *       slot. Our expectation is that allocations tend to occur in bursts for a
 *       given transaction (since we buffer write requests in the server) and
 *       tend to have good locality in the slot address space. Therefore we can
 *       use a chain of bit set chunks. Each chunk would have to identify the
 *       slot range to which it applied. Another representation would be a run
 *       length encoding of the allocated slots. The encoding could be built up
 *       directly as slots are allocated, and incrementally written onto a chain
 *       of slots itself. (This approach would fail if it were possible for the
 *       slots for a version written by a transaction to be deallocated during
 *       that transaction and then written on by another transaction. However,
 *       we only allow reuse of slots dedicated to prior versions within the
 *       same transaction.) When we finally deallocate the versions written in
 *       that transaction on the journal we simply mark all slots allocated by
 *       that transaction as deallocated in the global scope. We do not even
 *       need to scan the object allocation index for the transaction - it can
 *       simply be discarded.
