/**
 * A {@link BTree} mapping index names to an {@link Entry} containing the last
 * {@link Checkpoint} record committed for the named index and the timestamp of
 * that commit. The keys are Unicode strings using the default {@link Locale}.
 * <p>
 * Note: The {@link AbstractJournal} maintains an instance of this class that
 * evolves with each {@link AbstractJournal#commit()}. However, the journal
 * also makes use of historical states for the {@link Name2Addr} index in order
 * to resolve the historical state of a named index. Of necessity, the
 * {@link Name2Addr} objects used for this latter purpose MUST be distinct from
 * the evolving instance otherwise the current version of the named index would
 * be resolved. Note further that the historical {@link Name2Addr} states are
 * accessed using a canonicalizing mapping but that current evolving
 * {@link Name2Addr} instance is NOT part of that mapping.
 * 
 * FIXME Writes on {@link Name2Addr} are not isolated - they are immediately
 * visible to any concurrent {@link AbstractTask}. When a task completes
 * normally this is not a problem since {@link AbstractTask}s use exclusive
 * locks to avoid concurrent access to the unisolated indices. However, if a
 * task registers or drops an index and then fails its intention is not isolated
 * on {@link Name2Addr} and WILL be visible to subsequent tasks unless the
 * entire commit group is discarded.
 * <p>
 * One way to address this problem is to use a per-instance {@link ThreadLocal}
 * to isolate the writes on {@link Name2Addr} for an {@link AbstractTask}. The
 * task would then propagate those changes atomically onto the {@link Name2Addr}
 * instance after it checkpoints its indices. At this point the task is done
 * doing its work and any subsequent errors in the {@link Thread} running the
 * task would be inside of the group commit protocol.
 * <p>
 * This per-instance {@link ThreadLocal} would be interposed between the task
 * and the {@link #indexCache}.
 * <p>
 * The trick is how this might effect non-concurrent users of {@link Name2Addr} -
 * those directly using the {@link IJournal} API rather than submitting tasks
 * for concurrent execution.
 * <p>
 * AH HA!
 * <p>
 * The underlying problem has been in fact the visibility of changes to the
 * commit list. This has been showing up primarily as lost notifications of
 * dirty btrees. What happens is that a btree sends {@link Name2Addr} notice
 * that it is dirty. If that notice is CONCURRENT with
 * {@link #handleCommit(long)} then the notice is lost when the commit list is
 * cleared. I've jiggled the code a bit and that specific problem no longer
 * arises, but a notice can still arrive before a commit causing the named index
 * to be cleared from the commit list before the task has actually finished
 * execution - another we have another lost update! This is "patched" in
 * AbstractTask which is explicitly jambing things onto the commit list, but the
 * real change is to the visibility.
 * <p>
 * 
 * A tasks intentions towards the {@link Name2Addr} index (adds, drops, and
 * "hey, i'm dirty" MUST be buffered until the task completes and then
 * atomically migrated down onto the {@link Name2Addr} object where it will be
 * made restart safe with the next commit.
