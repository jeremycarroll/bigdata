/**
 * <p>
 * An interface invoked during backward validation when a write-write conflict
 * has been detected. The interface must either resolve the write-write conflict
 * by returning a new version in which the conflict is resolved or report an
 * unresolvable conflict, in which case backward validation will force the
 * transaction to abort.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: You MUST provide a public constructor with the signature: <code>
 * <i>class</i>( Journal journal )</code>
 * </p>
 * 
 * @see http://www.cs.brown.edu/~mph/Herlihy90a/p96-herlihy.pdf for an excellent
 *      discussion of data type specific state-based conflict resolution,
 *      including examples for things such as bank accounts.
 * 
 * @todo Write tests in which we do state-based conflict resolution for both the
 *       bank account examplres in Herlihy and the examples that we will find in
 *       race conditions for the lexical terms and statements in an RDF model.
 * 
 * @todo Will object deserialization be buffered by a cache? Cache integrity is
 *       tricky here since the objects being reconciled belong to different
 *       transactional states. I can see a situation in which conflict
 *       resolution requires multiple changes in a graph structure, and could
 *       require simultaneous traversal of both a read-only view of the last
 *       committed state on the journal and a read-write view of the
 *       transaction. Resolution would then proceed by WRITE or DELETE
 *       operations on the transaction. The method signature would be changed
 *       to:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * resolveConflict(int32 id,Tx readOnly,Tx readWrite)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This would have to allow READ,WRITE,and DELETE operations during PREPARE.<br>
 * 
 * This is nice, but is does require that we handle concurrent modification of
 * the object index during traversal (and concurrent traversal) since validation
 * is traversing the index while it is being used by the conflict resolver to
 * READ, WRITE, and DELETE objects. This can be handled with a non-persistence
 * capable object index simply by changing from {@link HashMap}
 * {@link ConcurrentHashMap}. Handling this for a persistence capable data
 * structure will require significantly more effort (but will provide a
 * worthwhile feature for btree support).<br>
 * 
 * Handling distributed conflicts could also require awareness of the int64
 * identifier. That is accessible to the caller if they have saved a reference
 * to the {@link Journal} in the constructor. Such resolution would have to be
 * network aware (i.e., aware that there was a distributed database). <br>
 * 
 * If we change to allowing object graph traverals during conflict resolution,
 * then we need to closely consider whether cycles can form and how they will
 * ground out.
