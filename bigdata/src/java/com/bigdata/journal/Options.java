/**
 * Options for the {@link Journal}. Options are specified as property values to
 * the {@link Journal#Journal(Properties)} constructor.
 * 
 * <h2>Write Cache</h2>
 * <p>
 * Some operating systems, file systems, disk controllers, and disk drives may
 * re-order writes, processing them in a different order from the sequence in
 * which they are issued by the application, and may return from
 * {@link FileChannel#force(boolean)} or {@link FileDescriptor#sync()} before
 * the data are on stable media. This can have the consequence that the root
 * blocks are laid down on the disk before the application data. In this
 * situation a hard failure during (or after!) the write could result in the
 * loss of application data since the root blocks representing the atomic commit
 * point MIGHT be updated before the application data was successfully made
 * stable on disk. Further, {@link IAtomicStore#commit()} MAY return before the
 * data are stable on disk.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Depending on your needs there are several steps which you can take to
 * increase data security, including backups, media replication, etc. In terms
 * of the {@link Journal} itself, you can use {@link #FORCE_WRITES} to request
 * synchronous writes or disable the write cache on your platform. While
 * {@link #FORCE_WRITES} is trivially specified as a configuration option,
 * please note that the behavior of {@link #FORCE_WRITES} can vary from platform
 * to platform and that disabling the write cache on your platform may give you
 * a greater assurance that writes are neither being reordered nor returning
 * before the data are on stable storage. Also note that some high end disk
 * systems have battery backup for the on-disk write cache, in which case you
 * may choose to leave the write cache on the disk enabled.
 * </p>
