 * @version $Id$

 * @todo Refactor to reflect the offset and length of the allocation and require
 *       that all allocations are contiguous. The case of a journal with fixed
 *       size slots can be handled by either special interpretation of the size
 *       field or by rounding up the object size to the slot size. Either way, a
 *       journal with fixed size slots is required iff we are supporting GC of
 *       versions no longer accessible to readers and reuse of deallocated space
 *       within the journal. If the architecture instead snapshots journals and
 *       divides their index key ranges into perfect btree segment files then we
 *       can do WORM style (perfect fit) allocations and allocations can be
 *       modeled by a simple "nextOffset" counter.
