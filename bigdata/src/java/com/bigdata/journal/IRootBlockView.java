 * <p>
 * Note that some file systems or disks can re-order writes of by the
 * application and write the data in a more efficient order. This can cause the
 * root blocks to be written before the application data is stable on disk. The
 * {@link Options#DOUBLE_SYNC} option exists to defeat this behavior and ensure
 * restart-safety for such systems.
