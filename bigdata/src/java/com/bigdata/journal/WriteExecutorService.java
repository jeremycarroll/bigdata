/**
 * A custom {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} used by the {@link ConcurrentJournal} to
 * execute concurrent unisolated write tasks and perform group commits. Tasks
 * extend {@link AbstractTask}. The caller receives a {@link Future} when they
 * submit a task to the write service. That {@link Future} is NOT available
 * until the next group commit following the successful execution of the write
 * task.
 * <p>
 * Note: adding the thread name to the log messages for this class can aid
 * debugging. You can do this using the log4j configuration.
 * <p>
 * Note: the problem with running concurrent unisolated operations during a
 * commit and relying on an "auto-commit" flag to indicate whether or not the
 * index will participate is two fold. First, previous unisolated operations on
 * the same index will not get committed if an operation is currently running,
 * so we could wind up deferring check points of indices for quite a while.
 * Second, if there is a problem with the commit and we have to abort, then any
 * ongoing operations would still be using unisolated indices that could include
 * write sets that were discarded - this would make abort non-atomic.
 * <p>
 * The ground state from which an unisolated operation begins needs to evolve
 * after each unisolated operation that reaches its commit point successfully.
 * This can be acomplished by holding onto the btree reference, or even just the
 * address at which the metadata record for the btree was last written. We use
 * {@link AbstractJournal#name2Addr} for this purpose.
 * <p>
 * However, if an unisolated write fails for any reason on a given index then we
 * MUST use the last successful check point for that index. This is handled by
 * doing an abort.
 * <p>
 * Note: Due to the way in which the {@link BTree} class is written, it "steals"
 * child references when cloning an immutable node or leaf prior to making
 * modifications. This means that we must reload the btree from a metadata
 * record if we have to roll back due to an abort of some unisolated operation
 * since the state of the {@link BTree} has been changed as a side effect in a
 * non-reversable manner.
