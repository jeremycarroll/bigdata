/**
 * A custom {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} used by the {@link ConcurrencyManager} to
 * execute concurrent unisolated write tasks and perform group commits. Tasks
 * extend {@link AbstractTask}. The caller receives a {@link Future} when they
 * submit a task to the write service. That {@link Future} is NOT available
 * until the next group commit following the successful execution of the write
 * task.
 * <p>
 * Note: adding the thread name to the log messages for this class can aid
 * debugging. You can do this using the log4j configuration.
 * <p>
 * Note: the problem with running concurrent unisolated operations during a
 * commit and relying on an "auto-commit" flag to indicate whether or not the
 * index will participate is two fold. First, previous unisolated operations on
 * the same index will not get committed if an operation is currently running,
 * so we could wind up deferring check points of indices for quite a while.
 * Second, if there is a problem with the commit and we have to abort, then any
 * ongoing operations would still be using unisolated indices that could include
 * write sets that were discarded - this would make abort non-atomic.
 * <p>
 * The ground state from which an unisolated operation begins needs to evolve
 * after each unisolated operation that reaches its commit point successfully.
 * This can be acomplished by holding onto the btree reference, or even just the
 * address at which the metadata record for the btree was last written. We use
 * {@link AbstractJournal#getName2Addr()} for this purpose.
 * <p>
 * However, if an unisolated write fails for any reason on a given index then we
 * MUST use the last successful check point for that index. This is handled by
 * doing an abort.
 * <p>
 * Note: Due to the way in which the {@link BTree} class is written, it "steals"
 * child references when cloning an immutable node or leaf prior to making
 * modifications. This means that we must reload the btree from a metadata
 * record if we have to roll back due to an abort of some unisolated operation
 * since the state of the {@link BTree} has been changed as a side effect in a
 * non-reversable manner.
 * <p>
 * Note: Running {@link Thread}s may be interrupted at arbitrary moments for a
 * number of reasons by this class. The foremost example is a {@link Thread}
 * that is executing an {@link AbstractTask} when a concurrent decision is made
 * to discard the commit group, e.g., because another task in that commit group
 * failed. Regardless of the reason, if the {@link Thread} is performing an NIO
 * operation at the moment that the interrupt is notice, then it will close the
 * channel on which that operation was being performed. If you are using a
 * disk-based {@link BufferMode} for the journal, then the interrupt just caused
 * the backing {@link FileChannel} to be closed. In order to permit continued
 * operations on the journal, the {@link IRawStore} MUST transparently re-open
 * the channel. (The same problem can arise if you are using NIO for sockets or
 * anything else that uses the {@link Channel} abstraction.)
 * 
 * <h2>Overflow handling</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The {@link WriteExecutorService} invokes {@link #overflow()} each time it
 * does a group commit. Normally the {@link WriteExecutorService} does not
 * quiese before doing a group commit, and when it is not quiesent the
 * {@link ResourceManager} can NOT {@link #overflow()} the journal since
 * concurrent tasks are still writing on the current journal. Therefore the
 * {@link ResourceManager} monitors the {@link IBufferStrategy#getExtent()} of
 * the live journal. When it decides that the live journal is large enough it
 * {@link WriteExecutorService#pause()}s {@link WriteExecutorService} and waits
 * until {@link #overflow()} is called with a quiesent
 * {@link WriteExecutorService}. This effectively grants the
 * {@link ResourceManager} exclusive access to the journal. It can then run
 * {@link #overflow()} to setup a new journal and tell the
 * {@link WriteExecutorService} to {@link WriteExecutorService#resume()}
 * processing.
