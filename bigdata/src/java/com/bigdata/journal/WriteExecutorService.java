/**
 * A custom {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} used by the {@link ConcurrentJournal} to
 * execute concurrent unisolated write tasks and perform group commits. Tasks
 * extend {@link AbstractTask}. The caller receives a {@link Future} when they
 * submit a task to the write service. That {@link Future} is NOT available
 * until the next group commit following the successful execution of the write
 * task.
 * <p>
 * Note: adding the thread name to the log messages for this class can aid
 * debugging. You can do this using the log4j configuration.
 * <p>
 * Note: the problem with running concurrent unisolated operations during a
 * commit and relying on an "auto-commit" flag to indicate whether or not the
 * index will participate is two fold. First, previous unisolated operations on
 * the same index will not get committed if an operation is currently running,
 * so we could wind up deferring check points of indices for quite a while.
 * Second, if there is a problem with the commit and we have to abort, then any
 * ongoing operations would still be using unisolated indices that could include
 * write sets that were discarded - this would make abort non-atomic.
 * <p>
 * The ground state from which an unisolated operation begins needs to evolve
 * after each unisolated operation that reaches its commit point successfully.
 * This can be acomplished by holding onto the btree reference, or even just the
 * address at which the metadata record for the btree was last written. We use
 * {@link AbstractJournal#name2Addr} for this purpose.
 * <p>
 * However, if an unisolated write fails for any reason on a given index then we
 * MUST use the last successful check point for that index. This is handled by
 * doing an abort.
 * <p>
 * Note: Due to the way in which the {@link BTree} class is written, it "steals"
 * child references when cloning an immutable node or leaf prior to making
 * modifications. This means that we must reload the btree from a metadata
 * record if we have to roll back due to an abort of some unisolated operation
 * since the state of the {@link BTree} has been changed as a side effect in a
 * non-reversable manner.
 * <p>
 * Note: Running {@link Thread}s may be interrupted at arbitrary moments for a
 * number of reasons by this class. The foremost example is a {@link Thread}
 * that is executing an {@link AbstractTask} when a concurrent decision is made
 * to discard the commit group, e.g., because another task in that commit group
 * failed. Regardless of the reason, if the {@link Thread} is performing an NIO
 * operation at the moment that the interrupt is notice, then it will close the
 * channel on which that operation was being performed. If you are using a
 * disk-based {@link BufferMode} for the journal, then the interrupt just caused
 * the backing {@link FileChannel} to be closed. In order to permit continued
 * operations on the journal, the {@link IRawStore} MUST transparently re-open
 * the channel. (The same problem can arise if you are using NIO for sockets or
 * anything else that uses the {@link Channel} abstraction.)
 * 
 * @todo The thread pool is essentially used as a queue to force tasks which
 *       have completed to await the commit. Consider placing a limit on the #of
 *       running threads when the thread pool is very large in case (a) a large
 *       #of threads would otherwise begin to execute tasks concurrently; and
 *       (b) the processor allocation strategy causes all threads to perform
 *       very slowly.
 * 
 * FIXME Write a test that runs concurrent unisolated readers, unisolated
 * writers, and transactions and make sure that everything is Ok. There really
 * should be a correctness test here. The best way to do that may be to write a
 * correctness test for each of the three executor services (readers, writers,
 * and isolated transactions) and then to run all three tests at once against
 * the same store. As long as they use distinct indices there should be no
 * conflicts caused by the tests.

     * task that completes successfully. In each commit group, the group commit
     * will be executed in the {@link Thread} of the first task that calls this
     * method. At that point the thread pool is {@link #pause() paused} so that
     * no more tasks may begin to execute. Each running task that completes
     * before a timeout invoke this method in turn, causing it to await the
     * {@link #commit} signal. Once there are no more running tasks the store
     * will be committed. The set of tasks that were running when the thread
     * pool was {@link #pause() paused} will form the "commit group".
     * <p>
     * If there is a problem during the commit protocol then the write set(s)
     * are abandoned using {@link #abort()}. If there is a timeout waiting for
     * the running tasks to complete, then any {@link #active} tasks are
     * {@link Thread#interrupt() interrupted}. When they notice that they have
     * been interrupted they SHOULD throw an exception that will be propagated
     * back to the caller and made available via their {@link Future}. If the
     * thread {@link Thread#isInterrupted()} when entering
     * {@link #afterTask(Callable, Throwable)} then an exception will be thrown
     * since the task failed to notice the interrupt.
