     * commit time and more recent commit points will not become visible.
     * <p>
     * {@link AbstractTask}s that run with read-committed isolation provide a
     * read-only view onto the most recently committed state of the indices on
     * which they read. However, when a process runs a series of
     * {@link AbstractTask}s with read-committed isolation the view of the
     * index in each distinct task will change if concurrenct processes commit
     * writes on the index (some constructs, such as the scale-out iterators,
     * provide read-consistent views for the last commit time). Further, an
     * index itself can appear or disappear if concurrent processes drop or
     * register that index.
     * <p>
     * A read-committed transaction imposes fewer constraints on when old
     * resources (historical journals and index segments) may be released. For
     * this reason, a read-committed transaction is a good choice when a
     * very-long running read must be performed on the database. Since a
     * read-committed transaction does not allow writes, the commit and abort
     * protocols are identical.
     * <p>
     * However, split/join/move operations can cause locators to become invalid
     * for read-committed (and unisolated) operations. For this reason, it is
     * often better to specify "read-consistent" semantics by giving the
     * lastCommitTime for the {@link IIndexStore}.
