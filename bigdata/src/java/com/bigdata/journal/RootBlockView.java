     * <dd>A byte value which specifies whether the backing store is a journal
     * (log-structured store or WORM) or a read-write store. Only two values are
     * defined at present. See {@link StoreTypeEnum}.</dd>
     * <dt>metaBitsAddr</dt>
     * <dd>Where we will read the metadata bits from. When we start the store up
     * we need to retrieve the metabits from this address. This is a byte offset
     * into the file and is stored as a long integer. Normal addresses are
     * calculated with reference to the allocation blocks.</dd>
     * <dt>metaStartAddr</dt>
     * <dd>The start of the area of the file where the allocation blocks are
     * allocated. This is also a byte offset into the file and is stored as a
     * 64-bit integer. It is called metaStartAddr because that is the offset
     * that is used with the metaBitsAddr to determine how to find the
     * allocation blocks.</dd>
     * </dl>

     * {@link RWStore}
     * <dl>
     * <dt>nextOffset</dt>

     * large chunk would be allocated in order to obtain space for additional
     * allocation blocks. This field does not change when user level allocations
     * are made.</dd>
     * <dt>offsetBits</dt>
     * <dd>This field is ignored by the {@link RWStore}.</dd>
     * </dl>
     * The head of the delete block chain is stored in the {@link ICommitRecord}
     * so we know the address of the start of each delete block chain for each
     * commit point on the store, which is why it is not stored in the root
     * blocks.
