/**
 * A read-committed transaction provides a read-only view onto the current
 * committed state of the database. Each time a view of an index is requested
 * using {@link #getIndex(String)} the returned view will provide access to the
 * most recent committed state for that index. Unlike a fully isolated
 * transaction, a read-committed transaction does NOT provide a consistent view
 * of the database over time. However, a read-committed transaction imposes
 * fewer constraints on when old resources (historical journals and index
 * segments) may be released. For this reason, a read-committed transaction is a
 * good choice when a very-long running read must be performed on the database.
 * Since a read-committed transaction does not allow writes, the commit and
 * abort protocols are identical.
 * 
 * @todo In order to release the resourcs associated with a commit point
 *       (historical journals and index segments) we need a protocol by which a
 *       delegate index view is explicitly closed (or collected using a weak
 *       value cache) once it is no longer in use for an operation. The index
 *       views need to be accumulated on a commit point (aka commit record).
 *       When no index views for a given commit record are active, the commit
 *       point is no longer accessible to the read-committed transaction and
 *       should be released. Resources (journals and index segments) required to
 *       present views on that commit point MAY be released once there are no
 *       longer any fully isolated transactions whose start time would select
 *       that commit point as their ground state.
 * 
 * @todo We may not even need a start time for a read-committed transaction
 *       since it always reads from the most recent commit record, in which case
 *       it could be started and finished with lower latency than a
 *       fully-isolated read-only or read-write transaction.

     * Light-weight implementation of a read-committed index view.
     * <p>
     * A delegation model is used since commits or overflows of the journal
     * might invalidate the index objects that actually read on the journal
     * and/or index segments. The delegation strategy checks the commit counters
     * and looks up a new delegate index object each time the commit counter is
     * updated. In this way, newly committed data are always made visible to the
     * next operation on the index. In-progress writes are NOT visible since we
     * only read from a delegate index discovered by resolving the index name
     * against the most recent {@link ICommitRecord}.

     * @todo if we add an extensible batch index operation then we need to make
     *       sure that it is not possible to use that to circumvent the
     *       read-only contract and write on the unisolated delegate index. For
     *       the same reason, it makes sense to make this class <em>final</em>
     *       and to make {@link #getIndex()} private.
