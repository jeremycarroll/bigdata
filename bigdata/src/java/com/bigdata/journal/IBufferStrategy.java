     * FIXME This must be a long integer for the {@link BufferMode#Disk}
     * strategy. The other strategies all use an int limit. That means that we
     * need to hide the actual field a little more, but we also need to change
     * the APIs to pass a long slot value everywhere.
     * 
     * The problem with changing to a long integer is that the priorSlot and
     * nextSlot fields in the slot header then need to be changed from int32 to
     * int64 fields. That will have a significiant impact on the journal size.
     * 
     * My preference is to have two {@link SlotMath} implementations, one of
     * which supports int32 slot indices and the other of which supports int64
     * slot indices. The APIs could then use int64 (long) throughout, and it
     * will be downcast to int32 (int) when using a disk-based journal.
     * 
     * However, this introduces another complication - the disk-based journal
     * would have to have a different binary format when the intention was to
     * address more than {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} slots. Since that is
     * definately NOT the sweet spot for the journal or bigdata, the "right"
     * thing may be to keep the slot index as an int32. Hence, I am not changing
     * anything right now. The {@link BufferMode#Disk} SHOULD still be able to
     * address files with more than {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} bytes, just not
     * files with more than {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} slots.
     * 
     * @todo Add test cases that verify correct fence post semantics for
     *       {@link BufferMode#Disk} as outlined above.
