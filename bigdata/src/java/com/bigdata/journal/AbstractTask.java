/**
 * Abstract base class for tasks that may be submitted to the
 * {@link ConcurrencyManager}. Tasks may be isolated (by a transaction),
 * unisolated, read-committed, or historical reads. Tasks access named resources
 * (aka indices), which they pre-declare in their constructors.
 * <p>
 * A read-committed task runs against the most recently committed view of the
 * named index. A historical read task runs against a historical view of the
 * named index, but without guarantees of transactional isolation. Concurrent
 * readers are permitted without locking on the same index.
 * <p>
 * An unisolated task reads and writes on the "live" index. Note that only a
 * single thread may write on a {@link BTree} at a time. Therefore unisolated
 * tasks (often referred to as writers) obtain an exclusive lock on the named
 * index(s). When more than one named index is used, the locks are used to infer
 * a partial ordering of the writers allowing as much concurrency as possible.
 * Pre-declaration of locks allows us to avoid deadlocks in the lock system.
 * <p>
 * Isolated tasks are part of a larger transaction. Transactions are started and
 * committed using an {@link ITransactionManagerService}. Transactional tasks
 * run with full concurrency using an MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)
 * strategy. When a transaction is committed (by the
 * {@link ITransactionManagerService}) it must wait for lock(s) on the
 * unisolated named indices on which it has written before it may validate and
 * commit.
 * <p>
 * Note: You MUST submit a distinct instance of this task each time you
 * {@link ConcurrencyManager#submit(AbstractTask)} it.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>

 * @todo declare generic type for the return as <? extends Object> to be compatible
 * with {@link ConcurrencyManager#submit(AbstractTask)}
