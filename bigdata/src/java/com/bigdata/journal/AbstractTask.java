/**
 * Abstract base class for tasks that may be submitted to an
 * {@link IConcurrencyManager}. Tasks may be isolated (by a transaction) or
 * unisolated. Tasks access named resources (aka indices), which they
 * pre-declare in their constructors.
 * <p>
 * Isolated tasks are part of a larger transaction. Transactions are started and
 * committed using an {@link ITransactionManagerService}. Several kinds of
 * isolation are supported - see {@link IsolationEnum}. Transactional tasks run
 * with full concurrency using an MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)
 * strategy. When a transaction is committed (by the
 * {@link ITransactionManagerService}) it must wait for lock(s) on the
 * unisolated named indices on which it has written before it may validate and
 * commit.
 * <p>
 * Unisolated tasks are further divided into read only and read/write. A
 * read-only task reads against the last committed state of a named index.
 * Concurrent unisolated readers are permitted without locking on the same
 * index.
 * <p>
 * A read/write task reads and writes on the "live" index. Note that only a
 * single thread may write on a {@link BTree} at a time. Therefore read/write
 * tasks (often referred to as writers) obtain an exclusive lock on the named
 * index(s). When more than one named index is used, the locks are used to infer
 * a partial ordering of the writers allowing as much concurrency as possible.
 * Pre-declaration of locks allows us to avoid deadlocks in the lock system.
 * <p>
 * Note: Use a distinct instance of this task each time you
 * {@link ConcurrencyManager#submit(AbstractTask)} it!
 * 
 * @todo review javadoc here and on {@link AbstractJournal} and the
 *       {@link IConcurrencyManager} interface.
