/**
 * A journal that supports concurrent of operations on unisolated named indices.
 * The journal uses a {@link LockManager} to administer exclusive locks on
 * unisolated named indices and thereby identify a schedule of operations such
 * that access to an unisolated named index is always single threaded while
 * access to distinct unisolated named indices MAY be concurrent.
 * <p>
 * The journal have several thread pools that facilitate concurrency. They are:
 * <dl>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link #txService}</dt>
 * <dd>This is used for the "active" phrase of transaction. Transactions read
 * from historical states of named indices during their active phase and buffer
 * the results on isolated indices. Since transactions never write on the
 * unisolated indices during their "active" phase distinct transactions may be
 * run with arbitrary concurrency. However, concurrent tasks for the same
 * transaction must obtain an exclusive lock on the isolated index that is used
 * to buffer their writes. A transaction that requests a commit using the
 * {@link ITransactionManager} results in a task being submitted to the
 * {@link #writeService}. Transactions are selected to commit once they have
 * acquired a lock on the corresponding unisolated indices, thereby enforcing
 * serialization of their write sets both among other transactions and among
 * unisolated writers. The commit itself consists of the standard validation and
 * merge phrases.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link #readService}</dt>
 * <dd>Concurrent unisolated readers running against the <strong>historical</strong>
 * state of a named index. No locking is imposed. Concurrency is limited by the
 * size of the thread pool, but large thread pools can reduce overall
 * performance..</dd>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link #writeService}</dt>
 * <dd>Concurrent unisolated writers running against the <strong>current</strong>
 * state of (or more more) named index(s) (the "live" or "mutable" index(s)).
 * The underlying {@link BTree} is NOT thread-safe. Therefore writers MUST
 * predeclare their locks, which allows us to avoid deadlocks altogether. This
 * is also used to schedule the commit phrase of transactions. </dd>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link #commitService}</dt>
 * <dd>Schedules periodic group commits. </dd>
 * 
 * <dt>{@link #statusService}</dt>
 * <dd>Periodically {@link StatusTask#log}s counters.</dd>

     * Submit a task (asynchronous). Tasks will execute asynchronously in the

     * <p>
     * Note: Unisolated write tasks will NOT return before the next group commit
     * (exceptions may be thrown if the task fails or the commit fails). The
     * purpose of group commits is to provide higher throughput for writes on
     * the store by only syncing the data to disk periodically rather than after
     * every write. Group commits are scheduled by the {@link #commitService}.
     * The trigger conditions for group commits may be configured using
     * {@link Options}. If you are using the store in a single threaded context
     * then you may set {@link Options#WRITE_SERVICE_POOL_SIZE} to ONE (1) which
     * has the effect of triggering commit immediately after each unisolated
     * write. However, note that you can not sync a disk more than ~ 30-40 times
     * per second so your throughput in write operations per second will never
     * exceed that for a single-threaded application writing on a hard disk.
     * (Your mileage can vary if you are writing on a transient store or using a
     * durable medium other than disk).
     * <p>
     * Note: The isolated indices used by a {@link IsolationEnum#ReadWrite}
     * transaction are NOT thread-safe. Therefore a partial order is imposed
     * over concurrent tasks for the <strong>same</strong> transaction that
     * seek to read or write on the same index(s). Full concurrency is allowed
     * when different transactions access the same index(s), but write-write
