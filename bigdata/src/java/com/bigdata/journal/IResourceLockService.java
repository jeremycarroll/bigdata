/**
 * Interface for a low latency global lock service. Resources are identified by
 * a namespace and locks are granted for a <em>resource hierarchy</em>.The
 * resource hierarchy is defined as all strings having the namespace as a
 * prefix. A lock is either <em>exclusive</em> or <em>shared</em>. A exclusive
 * lock is exclusive of all other locks on the resource hierarchy, including
 * shared locks and other exclusive locks. Exclusive locks are normally used to
 * create or destroy a resource hierarchy. A shared lock simply prevents a
 * process from acquiring an exclusive lock and thereby ensures that the
 * resource hierarchy remains available.
