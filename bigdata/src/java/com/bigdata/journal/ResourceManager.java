/**
 * This class is responsible for integrating events that report on resource
 * consumption and latency and taking actions that may seek to minimize latency
 * or resource consumption.
 * <p>
 * Resource consumption events include
 * <ol>
 * <li>mutable unisolated indices open on the journal</li>
 * <li>mutable isolated indices open in writable transactions</li>
 * <li>historical read-only indices open on old journals</li>
 * <li>historical read-only index segments</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * The latter two classes of event sources exist iff {@link Journal#overflow()}
 * is handled by creating a new {@link Journal} and evicting data from the old
 * {@link Journal} asynchronously onto read-optimized {@link IndexSegment}s.
 * 
 * Other resource consumption events deal directly with transactions
 * <ol>
 * <li>open a transaction</li>
 * <li>close a transaction</li>
 * <li>a heartbeat for each write operation on a transaction is used to update
 * the resource consumption of the store</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Latency events include
 * <ol>
 * <li>request latency, that is, the time that a request waits on a queue
 * before being serviced</li>
 * <li>transactions per second</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * @todo report the partition identifier as part of the index segment events.
 * 
 * @todo use a hard reference queue to track recently used AbstractBTrees. a a
 *       public referenceCount field on AbstractBTree and close the
 *       AbstractBTree on eviction from the hard reference queue iff the
 *       referenceCount is zero (no references to that AbstractBTree remain on
 *       the hard reference queue).
 * 
 * @todo consider handling close out of index partitions "whole at once" to
 *       include all index segments in the current view of that partition. this
 *       probably does not matter might be a nicer level of aggregation than the
 *       individual index segment.
 * 
 * @todo this still does not suggest a mechanism for close by timeout. one
 *       solutions is to just close down all open indices if the server quieses.
 *       if the server is not quiesent then unused indices will get shutdown in
 *       any case.
