/**
 * Disk-based journal strategy.
 * <p>
 * Writes are buffered in a write cache. The cache is flushed when it would
 * overflow. As a result only large sequential writes are performed on the
 * store. Reads read through the write cache for consistency.
 * 
 * FIXME Examine behavior when write caching is enabled/disabled for the OS.
 * This has a profound impact. Asynchronous writes of multiple buffers, and the
 * use of smaller buffers, may be absolutely when the write cache is disabled.
 * It may be that swapping sets in because the Windows write cache is being
 * overworked, in which case doing incremental and async IO would help. Compare
 * with behavior on server platforms. See
 * http://support.microsoft.com/kb/259716,
 * http://www.accucadd.com/TechNotes/Cache/WriteBehindCache.htm,
 * http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365165.aspx,
 * http://www.jasonbrome.com/blog/archives/2004/04/03/writecache_enabled.html,
 * http://support.microsoft.com/kb/811392,
 * http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/db-derby-dev/200609.mbox/%3C44F820A8.6000000@sun.com%3E
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    /sbin/hdparm -W 0 /dev/hda 0 Disable write caching
 *    /sbin/hdparm -W 1 /dev/hda 1 Enable write caching
 * </pre>
 * 
 * @todo The flush of the write cache could be made asynchronous if we had two
 *       write buffers, but that increases the complexity significantly. It
 *       would have to be synchronous if invoked from {@link #force(boolean)} in
 *       any case.
 *       <p>
 *       Reconsider a 2nd buffer so that we can avoid waiting on the writes to
 *       disk. Use
 *       {@link Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor(java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory)
 *       to obtain the 2nd (daemon) thread and an. {@link Exchanger}.
 *       <p>
 *       Consider the generalization where a WriteCache encapulates the logic
 *       that exists in this class and where we have a {@link BlockingQueue} of
 *       available write caches. There is one "writable" writeCache object at
 *       any given time, unless we are blocked waiting for one to show up on the
 *       availableQueue. When a WriteCache is full it is placed onto a
 *       writeQueue. A thread reads from the writeQueue and performs writes,
 *       placing empty WriteCache objects onto the availableQueue. Sync places
 *       the current writeCache on the writeQueue and then waits on the
 *       writeQueue to be empty.
 *       <p>
 *       Consider that a WriteCache also doubles as a read cache IF we create
 *       write cache objects encapsulating reads that we read directly from the
 *       disk rather than from a WriteCache. In this case we might do a larger
 *       read so as to populate more of the WriteCache object in the hope that
 *       we will have more hits in that part of the journal.
 *       <p>
 *       Note: Most reads are nodes and leaves of {@link BTree}s which are
 *       already cached by the btree and should not stay long in a read cache in
 *       the journal itself - they will only be re-read if we reload the
 *       {@link BTree} from its {@link IndexMetadata}. Some reads are
 *       {@link IndexMetadata} records and there are a few {@link ICommitRecord}s.
 *       That is all the different kinds of objects in the store at this time.
 *       If we develop a read/write variant of the store then the metadata for
 *       the allocation blocks will need to be cached.
 *       <p>
 *       Currently, GC of nodes in the btree is driving reads.
 *       <p>
 *       Async read ahead should be explored for rangeIterators in the
 *       {@link BTree}. This could reduce latency waiting on the disk to zero
 *       for range scans.
 * 
 * FIXME Add lazy creation of the backing file so that we can use the
 * {@link DiskOnlyStrategy} for temporary stores as well. The backing file will
 * never be created unless the write cache overflows. Since we write the root
 * blocks when we create the file, we have to be careful and make sure that the
 * store is initialized properly. Note that this will also mean that the temp
 * store can support commits, which it does not really need to do.
 * 
 * @todo A separate read cache could be used for hot records, but the B+Tree
 *       implementations already buffer nodes and leaves so this is unlike to
 *       help anything using indices rather than just the {@link IRawStore}
 *       interface. For this reason you can expect performance tests such as
 *       {@link AbstractMRMWTestCase} to under-report the effective read
 *       performance of the store. Tests written at the B+Tree level are a
 *       better guide here.
 * 
 * @todo test verifying that large records are written directly and that the
 *       write cache is properly flush beforehand.
 * 
 * @todo test verifying that the write cache can be disabled.
 * 
 * @todo test verifying that {@link #writeCacheOffset} is restored correctly on
 *       restart (ie., you can continue to append to the store after restart and
 *       the result is valid).
 * 
 * @todo test verifying that the buffer position and limit are updated correctly
 *       by {@link #write(ByteBuffer)} regardless of the code path.
 * 
 * @todo config parameter for buffer size, direct vs heap allocation of the
 *       {@link #writeCache}, and whether or not the {@link #writeCache} is
 *       enabled.
 * 
 * @todo Retro fit the concept of a write cache into the
 *       {@link DirectBufferStrategy} so that we defer writes onto the disk
 *       until (a) a threshold of data has been buffered; or (b)
 *       {@link #force(boolean)} is invoked. Note that the implementation will
 *       be a bit different since the Direct mode is already fully buffered so
 *       we do not need to allocate a separate writeCache. However, we will
 *       still need to track the {@link #writeCacheOffset} and maintain a
 *       {@link #writeCacheIndex}.
