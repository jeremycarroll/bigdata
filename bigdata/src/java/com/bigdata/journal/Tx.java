/**
 * <p>
 * A transaction. A transaction is a context in which the application can access
 * and perform operations on named indices in which the operations will be
 * isolated according to the isolation level of the transaction. When using a
 * writable isolated transaction, writes are accumulated in an
 * {@link IsolatedFusedView}. The write set is validated when the transaction
 * {@link #prepare()}s. The write set is merged down onto the global state when
 * the transaction commits. When the transaction is read-only, writes will be
 * rejected and {@link #prepare()} and {@link #commit()} are NOPs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The write set of a transaction is written onto a {@link TemporaryRawStore}.
 * Therefore the size limit on the transaction write set is currently 2G, but
 * the transaction will be buffered in memory until the store exceeds its write
 * cache size and creates a backing file on the disk. The store is closed and
 * any backing file is deleted as soon as the transaction completes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each {@link IsolatedFusedView} is local to a transaction and is backed by the
 * temporary store for that transaction. This means that concurrent transactions
 * can execute without synchronization (real concurrency) up to the point where
 * they {@link #prepare()}. We do not need a read-lock on the indices isolated
 * by the transaction since they are <em>historical</em> states that will not
 * receive concurrent updates.
 * </p>

 * 
 * @todo In order to support a distributed transaction commit protocol the write
 *       set of a validated transaction needs to be made restart safe without
 *       making it restart safe on the corresponding unisolated index on the
 *       journal. It may be that the right thing to do is to write the validated
 *       data onto the unisolated indices but not commit the journal and not
 *       permit other unisolated writes until the commit message arives, e.g.,
 *       block in the {@link AbstractJournal#writeService} waiting on the commit
 *       message. A timeout would cause the buffered writes to be discarded (by
 *       an abort).
 * 
 * @todo track whether or not the transaction has written any isolated data (I
 *       currently rangeCount the isolated indices in {@link #isEmptyWriteSet()}).
 *       do this at the same time that I modify the isolated indices use a
 *       delegation strategy so that I can trap attempts to access an isolated
 *       index once the transaction is no longer active. define "active" as up
 *       to the point where a "commit" or "abort" is _requested_ for the tx.
 * 
 * @todo The various public methods on this API that have {@link RunState}
 *       constraints all eagerly force an abort when invoked from an illegal
 *       state. This is, perhaps, excessive. Futher, since this is used in a
 *       single-threaded server context (the {@link AbstractTask} needs to
 *       manage resource locks for the isolated indices when there are
 *       concurrent tasks executing for the same transaction), we are better off
 *       testing for illegal conditions and notifying clients without out
 *       generating expensive stack traces. This could be done by return flags
 *       or by the server checking pre-conditions itself and exceptions being
 *       thrown from here if the server failed to test the pre-conditions and
 *       they were not met
