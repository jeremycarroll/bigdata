/**
 * <p>
 * A transaction. An instance of this class corresponds to a transaction.
 * Transactions are fully isolated.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Transaction isolation is accomplished as follows. Within a transaction, the
 * most recently written data version is visible. This is accomplished using
 * copy on write semantics for the object index nodes. Originally the
 * transaction executes with a clean view of the last committed object index at
 * of the time that the transaction began. Each time an update is made within
 * the transaction to the object index, a test is performed to see whether the
 * target object index node is clean (same state as when the transaction
 * started). If it is clean, then the node and its ancenstors are cloned (copy
 * on write) and the change is applied to the copy. WRITE operations simply
 * update the first slot on which the current version (within the transaction
 * scope) is written. DELETE operations write a flag into the object index, but
 * do NOT remove the entry for the data from the index. READ operations are
 * performed against this view of the object index, and therefore always read
 * the most recent version (but note that an object not found in the journal
 * MUST be resolved against the corresponding database segment).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In a PREPARE operation, dirty index nodes in the transaction scope are merged
 * with the most recent committed state of the object index (backward
 * validation). This merge is used to detect write-write conflicts, which are
 * then resolved by state-based conflict resolution (e.g., merge rules). All
 * dirty object index nodes are flushed to disk during the prepare, but the root
 * block is not updated until the COMMIT.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo Define isolation for the allocation index. We can actually ignore the
 *       problem and only sacrifice the ability to reuse slots allocated to data
 *       versions within the transaction that are subsequently updated or
 *       deleted within the same transaction. This is a special case and
 *       doubtless of benefit, but we can get by with a flag bit set if we
 *       ignore that case.
 * 
 * @todo Define the commit procotol.
 * 
 * @todo Is it possible to have more than one transaction PREPARE must
 *       concurrent PREPARE operations be serialized?
 * 
 * @todo Define the abort protocol. On abort, the root block is simply not
 *       updated, all current data versions in the transaction scope are marked
 *       as available, and the slots dedicated to the transaction scope object
 *       index nodes are themselves marked as available. (This could be done
 *       asynchronously but we have not yet defined a slot reaper. This will
 *       have to be interleaved with the thread performing operations on the
 *       journal. So, either they are the same thread that somehow switches
 *       tasks, or the journal is handed off between threads based on workload
 *       (sounds good), or we have to make the journal thread safe.)
 * 
 * @todo Define a mechanism for generating transaction identifiers. They could
 *       be UUIDs, which would make it very easy to create them but we would
 *       have to transmit transaction metadata for the concurrency control (CC)
 *       strategy, especially the timestamp. Typically the transaction
 *       identifier is simply a timestamp, but that can be overly constraining
 *       depending on the CC strategy. Since we probably need better than millis
 *       resolution, we could shift out the high bytes and bring in some nanos.
 *       We also need to bring in host information or have a centralized server
 *       that generates transaction identifiers that are guarenteed to be unique
 *       (pay a little in latency, but easy to do).
 * 
 * @todo This implementation actually uses a two level transient hash map for
 *       the object index (this is not restart safe). The first level is the
 *       transaction scope object index. All changes are made to that index. If
 *       an object is not found in that index, then we read the entry from the
 *       base object index. If it is not found there, then it is not found
 *       period.
