/**
 * <p>
 * A transaction. A transaction is a context in which the application can access
 * named indices, and perform operations on those indices, and the operations
 * will be isolated according to the isolation level of the transaction. When
 * using a writable isolated transaction, writes are accumulated in an
 * {@link IsolatedBTree}. The write set is validated when the transaction
 * {@link #prepare()}s and finally merged down onto the global state when the
 * transaction commits. When the transaction is read-only, writes will be
 * rejected and {@link #prepare()} and {@link #commit()} are NOPs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The write set of a transaction is written onto a {@link TemporaryStore}.
 * Therefore the size limit on the transaction write set is currently 2G, but
 * the transaction will run in memory up to 100M. The {@link TemporaryStore} is
 * closed and any backing file is deleted as soon as the transaction completes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each {@link IsolatedBTree} is local to a transaction and is backed by its own
 * store. This means that concurrent transactions can execute without
 * synchronization (real concurrency) up to the point where they
 * {@link #prepare()}. We do not need a read-lock on the indices isolated by
 * the transaction since they are <em>historical</em> states that will not
 * receive concurrent updates. This might prove to be a nice way to leverage
 * multiple processors / cores on a data server.
 * </p>

 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo Support read-committed transactions (data committed by _other_
 *       transactions during the transaction will be visible within that
 *       transaction). Read-committed transactions do NOT permit writes (they
 *       are read-only). Prepare and commit are NOPs. This might be a distinct
 *       implementation sharing a common base class for handling the run state
 *       stuff, or just a distinct implementation altogether. The read-committed
 *       transaction is implemented by just reading against the named indices on
 *       the journal. However, since commits or overflows of the journal might
 *       invalidate the index objects we may have to setup a delegation
 *       mechanism that resolves the named index either on each operation or
 *       whenever the transaction receives notice that the index must be
 *       discarded. In order to NOT see in-progress writes, the read-committed
 *       transaction actually needs to dynamically resolve the most recent
 *       {@link ICommitRecord} and then use the named indices resolved from
 *       that. This suggests an event notification mechanism for commits so that
 *       we can get the commit record more cheaply.
 * 
 * @todo Support transactions where the indices isolated by the transactions are
 *       {@link PartitionedIndex}es.
 * 
 * @todo Track which {@link IndexSegment}s and {@link Journal}s are required
 *       to support the {@link IsolatedBTree}s in use by a {@link Tx}. Deletes
 *       of old journals and index segments MUST be deferred until no
 *       transaction remains which can read those data. This metadata must be
 *       restart-safe so that resources are eventually deleted. On restart,
 *       active transactions will have been discarded abort and their resources
 *       released. (Do we need a restart-safe means to indicate the set of
 *       running transactions?)<br>
 *       There is also a requirement for quickly locating the specific journal
 *       and index segments required to support isolation of an index. This
 *       probably means an index into the history of the {@link MetadataIndex}
 *       (so we don't throw it away until no transactions can reach back that
 *       far) as well as an index into the named indices index -- perhaps simply
 *       an index by startTimestamp into the root addresses (or whole root block
 *       views, or moving the root addresses out of the root block and into the
 *       store with only the address of the root addresses in the root block).
 * 
 * @todo The various public methods on this API that have {@link RunState}
 *       constraints all eagerly force an abort when invoked from an illegal
 *       state. This is, perhaps, excessive. Futher, since this is used in a
 *       single-threaded server context, we are better off testing for illegal
 *       conditions and notifying clients without out generating expensive stack
 *       traces. This could be done by return flags or by the server checking
 *       pre-conditions itself and exceptions being thrown from here if the
 *       server failed to test the pre-conditions and they were not met
 * 
 * @todo PREPARE operations must be serialized unless they are provably
 *       non-overlapping. This will require a handshake with either the
 *       {@link Journal} or (more likely) the {@link TransactionServer}.
