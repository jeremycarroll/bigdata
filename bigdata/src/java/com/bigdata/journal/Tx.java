/**
 * <p>
 * A transaction. An instance of this class corresponds to a transaction.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A transaction is a context in which the application can access named btrees.
 * btrees returned within the transaction will be isolated according to the
 * isolation level of the transaction. transactions may be requested that are
 * read-only for some historical timestamp, that are read-committed (data
 * committed by _other_ transactions during the transaction will be visible
 * within that transaction), or that are fully isolated (changes made in other
 * transactions are not visible within the transaction).
 * 
 * When using an isolated transaction, changes are accumulated in an isolated
 * btree. The update set must then be validated and finally merged down onto the
 * global state when the transaction commits.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Transaction isolation is accomplished as follows. Within a transaction, the
 * most recently written data version is visible. This is accomplished using
 * copy on write semantics for the object index nodes. Originally the
 * transaction executes with a clean view of the last committed object index at
 * of the time that the transaction began. Each time an update is made within
 * the transaction to the object index, a test is performed to see whether the
 * target object index node is clean (same state as when the transaction
 * started). If it is clean, then the node and its ancenstors are cloned (copy
 * on write) and the change is applied to the copy. WRITE operations simply
 * update the first slot on which the current version (within the transaction
 * scope) is written. DELETE operations write a flag into the object index, but
 * do NOT remove the entry for the data from the index. READ operations are
 * performed against this view of the object index, and therefore always read
 * the most recent version (but note that an object not found in the journal
 * MUST be resolved against the corresponding database segment).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In a PREPARE operation, dirty index nodes in the transaction scope are merged
 * with the most recent committed state of the object index (backward
 * validation). This merge is used to detect write-write conflicts, which are
 * then resolved by state-based conflict resolution (e.g., merge rules). All
 * dirty object index nodes are flushed to disk during the prepare, but the root
 * block is not updated until the COMMIT.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo update javadoc.
 * 
 * @todo The various public methods on this API that have {@link RunState}
 *       constraints all eagerly force an abort when invoked from an illegal
 *       state. This is, perhaps, excessive. Futher, since this is used in a
 *       single-threaded server context, we are better off testing for illegal
 *       conditions and notifying clients without out generating expensive stack
 *       traces. This could be done by return flags or by the server checking
 *       pre-conditions itself and exceptions being thrown from here if the
 *       server failed to test the pre-conditions and they were not met
 * 
 * @todo Is it possible to have more than one transaction PREPARE must
 *       concurrent PREPARE operations be serialized?
