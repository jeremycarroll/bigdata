/**
 * <p>
 * A transaction. A transaction is a context in which the application can access
 * named indices, and perform operations on those indices, and the operations
 * will be isolated according to the isolation level of the transaction. When
 * using an isolated transaction, writes are accumulated in an
 * {@link IsolatedBTree}. The write set is validated when the transaction
 * {@link #prepare()}s and finally merged down onto the global state when the
 * transaction commits.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo Transactions may be requested that are read-only for some historical
 *       timestamp, that are read-committed (data committed by _other_
 *       transactions during the transaction will be visible within that
 *       transaction), or that are fully isolated (changes made in other
 *       transactions are not visible within the transaction).
 * 
 * @todo support {@link PartitionedIndex}es.
 * 
 * @todo Make the {@link IsolatedBTree}s safe across {@link Journal#overflow()}
 *       events. When {@link PartitionedIndex}es are used this adds a
 *       requirement for tracking which {@link IndexSegment}s and
 *       {@link Journal}s are required to support the {@link IsolatedBTree}.
 *       Deletes of old journals and index segments must be deferred until no
 *       transaction remains which can read those data. This metadata must be
 *       restart-safe so that resources are eventually deleted. On restart,
 *       active transactions will abort and their resources may be released.
 *       There is also a requirement for quickly locating the specific journal
 *       and index segments required to support isolation of an index. This
 *       probably means an index into the history of the {@link MetadataIndex}
 *       (so we don't throw it away until no transactions can reach back that
 *       far) as well as an index into the named indices index -- perhaps simply
 *       an index by timestamp into the root addresses (or whole root block
 *       views).
 * 
 * @todo The various public methods on this API that have {@link RunState}
 *       constraints all eagerly force an abort when invoked from an illegal
 *       state. This is, perhaps, excessive. Futher, since this is used in a
 *       single-threaded server context, we are better off testing for illegal
 *       conditions and notifying clients without out generating expensive stack
 *       traces. This could be done by return flags or by the server checking
 *       pre-conditions itself and exceptions being thrown from here if the
 *       server failed to test the pre-conditions and they were not met
 * 
 * @todo Is it possible to have more than one transaction PREPARE must
 *       concurrent PREPARE operations be serialized?
