/**
 * Interface for managing named indices.
 * 
 * FIXME Consider removing this interface for better alignment with the
 * {@link ConcurrentJournal}. Access to indices SHOULD only occur within
 * submitted {@link AbstractIndexTask}s. The presence of this interface on the
 * {@link ConcurrentJournal} makes it possible to access a named index outside
 * of an executor service. {@link AbstractJournal} SHOULD NOT implement
 * {@link IIndexStore#getIndex(String)} since that returns the
 * <strong>unisolated</strong> (mutable) view of the named index and access to
 * that view MUST be single-threaded, which is enforced by the
 * {@link ConcurrentJournal} only within {@link AbstractIndexTask}s.
 * <p>
 * Remove these methods from the {@link IJournal} heirarchy of implementations
 * but do retain them for {@link TemporaryStore} since it is (a) single-threaded
 * and (b) people need the ability to add/drop indices. The interface itself
 * could still go away.
 * <p>
 * Likewise {@link IIndexStore} needs to be available to
 * {@link AbstractIndexTask}s, on the {@link Tx}, and on
 * {@link TemporaryStore} but MUST NOT be exposed elsewhere.
 * <p>
 * A bunch of test cases will have to be updated and the RDFS database will also
 * have to be updated (to use more concurrency as well as to refactor its index
 * access inside of {@link AbstractIndexTask}s).
 * <p>
 * Get rid of {@link NoSuchIndexException} and {@link IndexExistsException} at
 * the same time since they are probably no longer.
 * <p>
 * Review {@link IDataService} methods for add/drop index.
 * <p>
 * Also drop {@link IAtomicStore#abort()} and {@link IAtomicStore#commit()}
 * since those operations are automatic, not something that can be directly
 * invoked by an application.
