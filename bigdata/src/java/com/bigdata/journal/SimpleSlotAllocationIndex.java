/**
 * Non-persistence capable implementation of a slot allocation index.
 * 
 * FIXME Write persistence capable implementation. The allocation needs to be
 * broken down into blocks (or chunks). We need to have a meta-allocation
 * structure that keeps track of commited allocation blocks. The ideal solution
 * would use a tree to store the meta-allocation structure so that we only have
 * to write nodes for the allocation blocks written on since the last commit,
 * but it would be nearly as efficient (since it is sequential block IO) to just
 * write the offsets of each valid allocation block. The allocation block data
 * structure itself could be the index of the firstSlot covered by that
 * allocation block and a bit set showing free vs allocated for N slots starting
 * with firstSlot.
 * 
 * @todo Support constant time lookup of the next allocation block that could
 *       allocate an object of a given #of slots. In order to do this we need to
 *       store an index into the bit set, perhaps one for each of M different
 *       allocation sizes. E.g., a 2 slot, 4 slot, 8 slot, etc. index that lets
 *       us create ordered free lists from the allocators by allocation size
 *       (the free list order reflects the order of the slots whose allocation
 *       state is recorded in the bit set of the allocation block).
 * 
 * @todo Write performance tests and tune implementation. Performance tests must
 *       handle allocation after wrap around of the journal when allocation
 *       needs to efficiently search for the next free space in a fragmented
 *       store. The allocation algorithm must also scale well, ideally constant
 *       cost, as the #of slots in the journal increases and as the store
 *       fragments.
