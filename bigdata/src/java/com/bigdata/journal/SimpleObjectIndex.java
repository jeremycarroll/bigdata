/**
 * This is a prototype implementation in order to proof out the concept for
 * transactional isolation. This implementation NOT persistence capable.
 * 
 * FIXME Integrate the new persistence capable B+-Tree support to provide a
 * persistence capable object index. The btree support provides copy-on-write,
 * which means that we do not need to close the base object index when starting
 * a new transaction. Other changes that need to be explored are (a) making the
 * objects inline within the index (clustered object index) vs managing
 * allocated slots on the {@link IRawStore}. This would result in a change to
 * the {@link IObjectIndexEntry} API. Also, the solution should be general in
 * that any kind of btree can be used with transactional isolation and multiple
 * btrees can be used at the same time with transactional isolation; and (b)
 * exploring opportunities for further efficiencies by moving some of the update
 * logic into a callback or behavior extension for the btree insert/update
 * method.
 * 
 * FIXME Write lots of tests for this interface as well as for transactional
 * isolation at the {@link Journal} and {@link Tx} API level. We will reuse
 * those for the persistence capable object index implementation.
 * 
 * @todo Write a persistence capable version that is efficient for all the
 *       things that we actually use the object index for. We need benchmarks
 *       that drive all of those activities (including migration to the
 *       read-optimized database and deletion of versions that are no longer
 *       accessible) in order to drive the algorithm, implementation, and
 *       performance tuning.<br>
 *       Some of the complex points are handling transaction isolation
 *       efficiently with minimal duplication of data and high performance and,
 *       in interaction with the slot allocation index, providing fast
 *       deallocation of slots no longer used by any active transaction - the
 *       current scheme essentially forces visitation of the slots to be
 *       deleted.
 * 
 * @todo A larger branching factor in the object index will result in fewer
 *       accesses to resolve a given identifier. This does not matter much when
 *       the journal is fully buffered, but it is critical when a journal uses a
 *       page buffer (unless the base object index and the per transaction
 *       object indices can be wired into memory).<br>
 *       A large branching factor is naturally in opposition to a smaller slot
 *       size. If larger nodes are used with smaller slot sizes then each index
 *       node will occupy multiple slots. It is possible to force allocation of
 *       those slots such that they are contiguous - this approach has the
 *       advantage that the journal remains an append-only store, but introduces
 *       complexity in allocation of index nodes. My expectation is that most
 *       allocations will be much smaller than index node allocations, but that
 *       many allocations will be made together since writes are buffered on a
 *       per tx basis before being applied to the journal. If it is also true
 *       that we tend to release the allocations for entire transactions at
 *       once, then this reduces the likelyhood that we will exhaust an extent
 *       for index node allocations through fragmentation. <br>
 *       Another approach would partition the journal (either within one file or
 *       into two files) so that part was reserved for object index nodes and
 *       part was reserved for slots. This would, pragmatically, result in two
 *       memory spaces each having fixed length slots - one for the objects and
 *       the slot allocation index blocks and one for the object index nodes.
 *       However, partitioning also goes directly against the requirement for an
 *       append-only store and would result in, essentially, twice as many
 *       append only data structures - and hence twice the disk head movement as
 *       a design that does not rely on either within file partition or a two
 *       file scheme.<br>

     * <p>
     * Merge the transaction scope object index onto the global scope object
     * index.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note: This method is invoked by a transaction during commit processing to
     * merge the write set of its object index into the global scope. This
     * operation does NOT check for conflicts. The pre-condition is that the
     * transaction has already been validated (hence, there will be no
     * conflicts). The method exists on the object index so that we can optimize
     * the traversal of the object index in an implementation specific manner
     * (vs exposing an iterator).  This method is also responsible for incrementing
     * the {@link IObjectIndexEntry#getVersionCounter() version counter}s that are
     * used to detect write-write conflicts during validation.
     * </p>
     * 
     * @todo For a persistence capable implementation of the object index we
     *       could clear currentVersionSlots during this operation since there
     *       should be no further access to that field. The only time that we
     *       will go re-visit the committed object index for the transaction is
     *       when we GC the pre-existing historical versions overwritten during
     *       that transaction. Given that, we do not even need to store the
     *       object index root for a committed transaction (unless we want to
     *       provide a feature for reading historical states, which is NOT part
     *       of the journal design). So another option is to just write a chain
     *       of {@link ISlotAllocation} objects. (Note, per the item below GC
     *       also needs to remove entries from the global object index so this
     *       optimization may not be practical). This could be a single long
     *       run-encoded slot allocation spit out onto a series of slots during
     *       PREPARE. When we GC the transaction, we just read the chain,
     *       deallocate the slots found on that chain, and then release the
     *       chain itself (it could have its own slots added to the end so that
     *       it is self-consuming). Just pay attention to ACID deallocation so
     *       that a partial operation does not have side-effects (at least, side
     *       effects that we do not want). This might require a 3-bit slot
     *       allocation index so that we can encode the conditional transition
     *       from (allocated + committed) to (deallocated + uncommitted) and
     *       know that on restart the state should be reset to (allocated +
     *       committed).
     * 
     * @todo GC should remove the 'deleted' entries from the global object index
     *       so that the index size does not grow without limit simply due to
     *       deleted versions. This makes it theoretically possible to reuse a
     *       persistent identifier once it has been deleted, is no longer
     *       visible to any active transaction, and has had the slots
     *       deallocated for its last valid version. However, in practice this
     *       would require that the logic minting new persistent identifiers
     *       received notice as old identifiers were expired and available for
     *       reuse. (Note that applications SHOULD use names to recover root
     *       objects from the store rather than their persistent identifiers.)
     * 
     * FIXME Validation of the object index MUST specifically treat the case
     * when no version for a persistent identifier exists in the ground state
     * for a tx, another tx begins and commits having written a version for that
     * identifier, and then this tx attempts to commit having written (or
     * written and deleted) a version for that identifier. Failure to treat this
     * case will cause problems during the merge since there will be an entry in
     * the global scope that was NOT visible to this transaction (which executed
     * against a distinct historical global scope). My take is the persistent
     * identifier assignment does not tend to have semantics (they are not
     * primary keys, but opaque identifiers) therefore we MUST NOT consider them
     * to be the same "object" and an unreconcilable write-write conflict MUST
     * be reported during validation. (Essentially, two transactions were handed
     * the same identifier for new objects.)
     *

     * in some detail.

                         * terminate quickly), in which case we could use a
                         * transient data structure to buffer concurrent
                         * modifications to the object index. In that case, we
                         * only need to buffer records that are actually
                         * overwritten during validation - but that change would
                         * need to be manifest throughout the object index
                         * support since it is essentially stateful (or by

                         * with a buffer!).
