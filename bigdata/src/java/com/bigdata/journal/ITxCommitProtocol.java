/**
 * An interface implemented by an {@link IDataService} for the commit / abort of
 * the local write set for a transaction as directed by a centralized
 * {@link ITransactionManager} in response to client requests.
 * <p>
 * Clients DO NOT make direct calls against this API. Instead, they MUST locate
 * the {@link ITransactionManager} service and direct messages to that service.
 * <p>
 * Note: These methods should be invoked iff the transaction manager knows that
 * the {@link IDataService} is buffering writes for the transaction.

 * FIXME in order to support 2-/3-phase commit, the [commitTime] from the
 * transaction manager service must be passed through to the journal. There also
 * needs to be a distinct "prepare" message that validates the write set of the
 * transaction and makes it restart safe. finally, i have to coordinate the
 * serialization of the wait for the "commit" message.
