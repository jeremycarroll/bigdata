/**
 * Disk-based Write Once Read Many (WORM) journal strategy. The phsyical layout
 * on the disk is the journal header, the root blocks, and then the user extent.
 * <p>
 * Writes are buffered in a write cache. The cache is flushed when it would
 * overflow. As a result only large sequential writes are performed on the
 * store. Reads read through the write cache for consistency.
 * <p>
 * Note: This is used to realize both the {@link BufferMode#Disk} and the
 * {@link BufferMode#Temporary} {@link BufferMode}s. When configured for the
 * {@link BufferMode#Temporary} mode: the root blocks will not be written onto
 * the disk, writes will not be forced, and the backing file will be created the
 * first time the {@link DiskOnlyStrategy} attempts to write through to the
 * disk. For many scenarios, the backing file will never be created unless the
 * write cache overflows. This provides very low latency on start-up, the same
 * MRMW capability, and allows very large temporary stores.
 * 
 * FIXME Examine behavior when write caching is enabled/disabled for the OS.
 * This has a profound impact. Asynchronous writes of multiple buffers, and the
 * use of smaller buffers, may be absolutely when the write cache is disabled.
 * It may be that swapping sets in because the Windows write cache is being
 * overworked, in which case doing incremental and async IO would help. Compare
 * with behavior on server platforms. See
 * http://support.microsoft.com/kb/259716,

 * 
 * @todo report whether or not the on-disk write cache is enabled for each
 *       platform in {@link AbstractStatisticsCollector}. offer guidance on how
 *       to disable that write cache.
 * 
 * @todo test verifying that large records are written directly and that the
 *       write cache is properly flush beforehand.
 * 
 * @todo test verifying that the write cache can be disabled.
 * 
 * @todo test verifying that the buffer position and limit are updated correctly
 *       by {@link #write(ByteBuffer)} regardless of the code path.
 * 
 * @todo Retro fit the concept of a write cache into the
 *       {@link DirectBufferStrategy} so that we defer writes onto the disk
 *       until (a) a threshold of data has been buffered; or (b)
 *       {@link #force(boolean)} is invoked. Note that the implementation will
 *       be a bit different since the Direct mode is already fully buffered so
 *       we do not need to allocate a separate writeCache. However, we will
 *       still need to track the {@link #writeCacheOffset} and maintain a
 *       {@link #writeCacheIndex}.
