/**
 * {@link QuorumPipeline} implementation.
 * <p>
 * The {@link QuorumMember} must pass along the "pipeline" messages, including:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link QuorumMember#pipelineAdd()}</li>
 * <li>{@link QuorumMember#pipelineRemove()}</li>
 * <li>{@link QuorumMember#pipelineChange(UUID, UUID)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * When a quorum is met, the <i>leader</i> is always first in the write pipeline
 * since it is the node which receives writes from clients. When a service joins
 * the write pipeline, it always does so at the end of the chain. Services may
 * enter the write pipeline before joining a quorum in order to synchronize with
 * the quorum. If a service in the middle of the chain leaves the pipeline, then
 * the upstream node will reconfigure and retransmit the current cache block to
 * its new downstream node. This prevent nodes which are "bouncing" during
 * synchronization from causing write sets to be discarded. However, if the
 * leader leaves the write pipeline, then the quorum is broken and the write set
 * will be discarded.
 * <p>
 * Since the write pipeline is used to synchronize services trying to join the
 * quorum as well as the replicate writes for services joined with the quorum,
 * {@link HAReceiveService} may be live for a met quorum even though the
 * {@link QuorumMember} on whose behalf this class is acting is not joined with
 * the met quorum.
 * 
 * <h3>Pipeline maintenance</h3>
 * 
 * There are three broad categories which have to be handled: (1) leader leaves;
 * (2) pipeline leader election; and (3) follower leaves. A leader leave causes
 * the quorum to break, which will cause service leaves and pipeline leaves for
 * all joined services. However, services must add themselves to the pipeline
 * before they join the quorum and the pipeline will be reorganized if necessary
 * when the quorum leader is elected. This will result in a
 * {@link #pipelineElectedLeader()} event. A follower leave only causes the
 * follower to leave the pipeline and results in a
 * {@link #pipelineChange(UUID, UUID)} event.
 * <p>
 * There are two cases for a follower leave: (A) when the follower did not did
 * not have a downstream node; and (B) when there is downstream node. For (B),
 * the upstream node from the left follower should reconfigure for the new
 * downstream node and retransmit the current cache block and the event should
 * be otherwise unnoticed.
 * <p>
 * Handling a follower join requires us to synchronize the follower first which
 * requires some more infrastructure and should be done as part of the HA
 * synchronization test suite.
 * <p>
 * What follows is an example of how events will arrive for a quorum of three
 * services: A, B, and C.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * A.getActor().pipelineAdd() => A.pipelineAdd()
 * B.getActor().pipelineAdd() => B.pipelineAdd(); A.pipelineChange(null,B); 
 * C.getActor().pipelineAdd() => C.pipelineAdd(); B.pipelineChange(null,C);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * At this point the pipeline order is <code>[A,B,C]</code>. Notice that the
 * {@link HASendService} for A is not established until the
 * <code>A.pipelineChange(null,B)</code> sets B as the new downstream service
 * for A. Likewise, B will not relay to C until it handles the
 * <code>B.pipelineChange(null,C)</code> event.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * Given the pipeline order <code>[A,B,C]</code>, if B were to leave, then the
 * events would be:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * B.getActor().pipelineRemove() => B.pipelineRemove(); A.pipelineChange(B,C);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and when this class handles the <code>A.pipelineChange(B,C)</code> event, it
 * must update the {@link HAReceiveService} such that it now relays data to C.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * On the other hand, given the pipeline order <code>[A,B,C]</code>, if C were
 * to leave the events would be:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * C.getActor().pipelineRemove() => C.pipelineRemove(); B.pipelineChange(C,null);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and when this class handles the <code>B.pipelineChange(C,null)</code> event,
 * it must update the C's {@link HAReceiveService} such that it continues to
 * receive data, but no longer relays data to a downstream service.
