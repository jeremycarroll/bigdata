/**
 * A non-remote interface for a member service in a {@link Quorum} defining
 * methods to support service specific high availability operations such as
 * reading on another member of the quorum, the 2-phase quorum commit protocol,
 * replicating writes, etc.
 * <p>
 * A {@link QuorumService} participates in a write pipeline, which replicates
 * cache blocks from the leader and relays them from service to service in the
 * {@link Quorum#getPipeline() pipeline order}. The write pipeline is
 * responsible for ensuring that the followers will have the same persistent
 * state as the leader at each commit point. Services which are synchronizing
 * may also join the write pipeline in order to receive updates before they join
 * a met quorum. See {@link QuorumPipeline}.
 * <p>
 * The leader uses a 2-phase commit protocol to ensure that the quorum enters
 * each commit point atomically and that followers can read historical commit
 * points, including on the prior commit point. See {@link QuorumCommit}.
 * <p>
 * Persistent services use pre-record checksums to detect read errors and can
 * handle read failures by reading on another service joined with the quorum.
 * See {@link QuorumRead}.
