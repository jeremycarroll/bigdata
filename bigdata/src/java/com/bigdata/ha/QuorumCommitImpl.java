    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     * <p>
     * This implementation runs the operation on the leader in the caller's
     * thread to avoid deadlock. The other services run the operation
     * asynchronously on their side while the leader awaits their future's using
     * get().
     * <p>
     * Note: The {@link IHA2PhasePrepareMessage} is sent to all services in
     * write pipeline. This ensures that services that are not yet joined with
     * the met quorum will still observe the root blocks. This is necessary in
     * order for them to catch up with the met quorum. The 2-phase commit
     * protocol is "aware" that not all messages are being sent to services
     * whose votes count. Only services that are actually in the met quorum get
     * a vote.
     * <p>
     * Note: This method is responsible for the atomic decision regarding
     * whether a service will be considered to be "joined" with the met quorum
     * for the 2-phase commit. A service that is synchronizing will either have
     * already voted the appropriate lastCommitTime and entered the met quorum
     * or it will not. That decision point is captured atomically when we obtain
     * a snapshot of the joined services from the quorum state. The decision is
     * propagated through the {@link IHA2PhasePrepareMessage} and that
     * information is retained by the service together with the new root block
     * from the prepare message. This metadata is used to decide how the service
     * will handle the prepare, commit, and abort messages.
