 * SlaveJournal is the object that talks between a remote MasterJournal and
 * a local Journal.
 * 
 * Whether the communication uses SmartProxy RMI, raw sockets or some other method, this will
 * pass on the data to the local Journal using direct method calls on the IBufferStrategy methods
 * 
 * The core methods provide the ability to syncronize the slave journal with the master through the
 * transference of update data.
 * 
 * Updating the rootblock will commit the slave journal.
 * 
 * For the RWStrategy, the rootblock update should be preceded with an allocation block update which will
 * include new and modified allocation blocks.
 * 
 * The use of the journal does not imply anything about cached data.  However, for the RWStrategy, the
 * allocation blocks must be synchronized with the commit, so these will be updated with a separate protocol
