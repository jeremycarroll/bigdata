/**
 * An interface for absolute get/put operations on a fixed slice of a byte[].
 * <p>
 * Note: For efficiency reasons this interface deliberately DOES NOT support
 * protecting the backing byte[] against mutation.
 * <p>
 * Note: This interface is designed for uses where {@link ByteBuffer} is not
 * appropriate, including those which require access to the backing byte[] for
 * efficiency. The use of this interface is encourage over {@link ByteBuffer}
 * unless you are going to read or write directly on the file system or network
 * channels. If you are performing operations on in-memory data records then
 * implementations of this interface can allow much more efficient operations.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo add bitwise operations with a given byte offset ala
 *       {@link BytesUtil#setBit(ByteBuffer, int, int, boolean)}. Copy the test
 *       suite as well.
