/**
 * An instance of this class manages a JVM-wide pool of direct (aka native)
 * {@link ByteBuffer}s. Methods are provided to acquire a {@link ByteBuffer}
 * from the pool and to release a {@link ByteBuffer} back to the pool.
 * <p>
 * Note: There is a bug in the release of large temporary direct
 * {@link ByteBuffer}s which motivates this class. For regular journals that
 * overflow, the write cache is allocated once and handed off from journal to
 * journal. However, there is no such opportunity for temporary stores.
 * Unfortunately it is NOT an option to simply disable the write cache for
 * temporary stores since NIO will allocate (and fail to release) an "temporary"
 * direct buffer for the operation which transfers the data from the
 * {@link TransientBufferStrategy} to disk. Therefore the data is copied into a
 * temporary buffer allocated from this pool and then the buffer is either
 * handed off to the {@link DiskOnlyStrategy} for use as its write cache (in
 * which case the {@link TemporaryRawStore} holds a reference to the buffer and
 * releases it back to those pool when it is finalized) or the buffer is
 * immediately released back to this pool.
 *
