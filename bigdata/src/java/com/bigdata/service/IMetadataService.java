 * instances responsible for each partition in the named index. Partitions are
 * automatically split when they overflow (~200M) and joined when they underflow
 * (~50M).
 * <p>
 * Note: methods on this interface MUST throw {@link IOException} in order to be
 * compatible with RMI.
 * 
 * @todo consider adding the timestamp of commit record for the data that was
 *       read such that a client can effect consistent read-only view simply by
 *       providing that timestamp to the next method call. This is especially
 *       relevant for the {@link IMetadataService} interface since clients need
 *       to make multiple requests for rangeCount and rangeIterator and the use
 *       of the same read-timestamp will make those requests consistent.
