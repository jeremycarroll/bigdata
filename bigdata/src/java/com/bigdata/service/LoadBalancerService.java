/**
 * The {@link LoadBalancerService} collects a variety of performance counters
 * from hosts and services, identifies over- and under- utilized hosts and
 * services based on the collected data and reports those to {@link DataService}s
 * so that they can auto-balance, and acts as a clearning house for WARN and
 * URGENT alerts for hosts and services.
 * <p>
 * While the {@link LoadBalancerService} MAY observe service start/stop events,
 * it does NOT get directly informed of actions that change the load
 * distribution, such as index partition moves or reading from a failover
 * service. Instead, {@link DataService}s determine whether or not they are
 * overloaded and, if so, query the {@link LoadBalancerService} for the identity
 * of under-utilized services. If under-utilized {@link DataService}s are
 * reported by the {@link LoadBalancerService} then the {@link DataService} will
 * self-identify index partitions to be shed and move them onto the identified
 * under-utilized {@link DataService}s. The {@link LoadBalancerService} learns
 * of these actions solely through their effect on host and service load as
 * self- reported by various services. *
 * <p>
 * Note: utilization should be defined in terms of transient system resources :
 * CPU, IO (DISK and NET), RAM. DISK exhaustion on the otherhand is the basis
 * for WARN or URGENT alerts since it can lead to immediate failure of all
 * services on the same host.
 * <p>
 * Note: When new services are made available, either on new hosts or on the
 * existing hardware, and service utilization discrepancies should become
 * rapidly apparent (within a few minutes). Once we have collected performance
 * counters for the new hosts / services, a subsequent overflow event(s) on
 * existing {@link DataService}(s) will cause index partition moves to be
 * nominated targetting the new hosts and services. The amount of time that it
 * takes to re-balance the load on the services will depend in part on the write
 * rate, since writes drive overflow events and index partition splits, both of
 * which lead to pre-conditions for index partition moves.
 * <p>
 * Note: If a host is suffering high IOWAIT then it is probably "hot for read"
 * (writes are heavily buffered and purely sequential and therefore unlikely to
 * cause high IOWAIT where as reads are typically random on journals even
 * through a key range scan is sequential on index segments). Therefore a "hot
 * for read" condition should be addressed by increasing the replication count
 * for those service(s) which are being swamped by read requests on a host
 * suffering from high IOWAIT.
 * 
 * @todo try writing move tests using a mock version of this service.
 * 
 * @todo we could significantly accelerate overflow events when new hardware is
 *       made available by setting the forceOverflow flag on the highly utilized
 *       data services. we probably don't want to do this for all highly
 *       utilized services at once since that could cause a lot of perturbation.
 * 
 * @todo Work out high-level alerting for resource exhaustion and failure to
 *       maintain QOS on individual machines, indices, and across the
 *       federation.
 * 
 * @todo All clients ({@link IBigdataClient}, {@link DataService},
 *       {@link IMapService}, etc) should issue WARN and URGENT notices. The
 *       client-side rules for those alerts should be configurable / pluggable /
 *       declarative. It would be great if the WARN and URGENT notices were able
 *       to carry some information about the nature of the emergency.
 * 
 * @todo should this service (in its Jini realization) track the discovered data
 *       services or base its decisions solely on reporting by the data
 *       services? note that services will have to
 *       {@link #notify(String, String))} as the first thing they do so that
 *       they quickly become available for assignment unless we are also doing
 *       service discovery.
 * 
 * @todo logging on this {@link LoadBalancerService#log} can provide a single
 *       point for administrators to configure email or other alerts.
 * 
 * @todo refactor so that we can use the same basic infrastructure for load
 *       balancing of other service classes as well, e.g., map/reduce services.
 * 
 * @see IRequiredHostCounters, A core set of variables to support
 *      decision-making.
 * 
 * @todo ping hosts?
 * 
 * @see http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=load+balancing+jini
 * 
 * @todo SNMP

 *       original counters (as averaged) and the massaged metrics on which we
 *       plan to make decisions.
