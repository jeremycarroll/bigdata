/**
 * Filter matches a {@link DataService} but not a {@link MetadataService}.

 * 
 * @todo This explicitly filters out service variants that extend
 *       {@link DataService} but which are not tasked as a
 *       {@link DataService} by the {@link MetadataService}. It would be
 *       easier if we refactored the interface hierarchy a bit so that there
 *       was a common interface and abstract class extended by both the
 *       {@link DataService} and the {@link MetadataService} such that we
 *       could match on their specific interfaces without the possibility of
 *       confusion.
