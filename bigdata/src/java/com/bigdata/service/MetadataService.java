/**
 * Implementation of a metadata service for a named scale-out index.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo Support creation and management of scale-out indices, including mapping
 *       their index partitions to data services. Build out this functionality
 *       with a series of test cases that invoke the basic operations
 *       (registerIndex (done), getPartition (done), putPartition,
 *       getPartitions, movePartition, etc.) and handle the load-balancing
 *       later.
 * 
 * @todo support transactionally isolated views onto the metadata index by
 *       passing in the tx identifier and using the appropriate historical view
 *       of the metadata index.
 * 
 * @todo Provide a means to reconstruct the metadata index from the journal and
 *       index segment data files. We tag each journal and index segment with a
 *       UUID. Each index is also tagged with a UUID, and that UUID is written
 *       into the metadata record for the index on each journal and index
 *       segment. Based on those UUIDs we are able to work backwards from the
 *       data on disk and identify the indices to which they belong. That
 *       information in combination with the timestamps in the metadata records
 *       and the first/last keys in the index partition is sufficient to
 *       regenerate the metadata indices.
 * 
 * @todo A temporal/immortable database can be realized if we never delete old
 *       journals since they contain the historical committed states of the
 *       database. The use of index segments would still provide fast read
 *       performance on recent data, while a suitable twist on the metadata
 *       index would allow access to those historical states. (E.g., you have to
 *       be able to access the historical state of the metadata index that
 *       corresponds to the commit time of interest for the database.)
 * 
 * @todo support two-tier metadata index and reconcile with
 *       {@link MetadataIndex} and {@link MasterJournal}.
 * 
 * @todo check all arguments (and on {@link IDataService}} as well. Arguments
 *       should also be tested on the client side of the interface.
 * 
 * @todo when a client accesses an index, if the #of partitions is small then
 *       just send them all back.
 * 
 * @todo the client (or the data services?) should send as async message every N
 *       seconds providing a histogram of the partitions they have touched (this
 *       could be input to the load balanced as well as info about the partition
 *       use that would inform MDS decision making).
 * 
 * @todo Tasks on the data service and manage the data on the journal and in the
 *       index segments while the corresponding tasks here update the partition
 *       metadata definitions. The general paradigm is that the data service
 *       operations need to be "safe" (idempotent) so that we can reexecute them
 *       in the worst case and the metadata service tasks need to codify changes
 *       in the data services. For example, an index split task initiated by the
 *       metadata service would be put onto a restart-safe schedule of tasks
 *       that the metadata service will run. The metadata service will run that
 *       task, at which point it will direct the data service to perform the
 *       partition split. If the metadata service fails before the data service
 *       reports success, then the task can simply be re-executed (in fact,
 *       tasks such as this do not need to be restart safe since there is no
 *       harm in the data service originating the split operation and there is
 *       no harm if the metadata service restarts and then figures out again
 *       that it wants to split that index partition -- as long as the data
 *       service can discard duplicate tasks). Eventually the data service will
 *       perform the split (even if it fails, the failover service will be
 *       directed to perform the split and the split will eventually occur).
 *       Once it performs the split, it needs to notify the metadata service
 *       which can then update the metadata for the partition (the old partition
 *       and its new right sibling). If the metadata service fails to notice the
 *       data service message indicating that it has performed the split, then
 *       it is still ok and the split can be re-requested later. The data
 *       service is responsible for making sure that its downstream failover
 *       services have the outputs from the split (new index segments) before
 *       notifying the metadata service that the split is complete.
