/**
 * Implementation of a metadata service for a named scale-out index.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo Support creation and management of scale-out indices, including mapping
 *       their index partitions to data services. Build out this functionality
 *       with a series of test cases that invoke the basic operations
 *       (registerIndex (done), getPartition (done), putPartition,
 *       getPartitions, movePartition, etc.) and handle the load-balancing
 *       later.
 * 
 * @todo support transactionally isolated views onto the metadata index by
 *       passing in the tx identifier and using the appropriate historical view
 *       of the metadata index.
 * 
 * @todo Provide a means to reconstruct the metadata index from the journal and
 *       index segment data files. We tag each journal and index segment with a
 *       UUID. Each index is also tagged with a UUID, and that UUID is written
 *       into the metadata record for the index on each journal and index
 *       segment. Based on those UUIDs we are able to work backwards from the
 *       data on disk and identify the indices to which they belong. That
 *       information in combination with the timestamps in the metadata records
 *       and the first/last keys in the index partition is sufficient to
 *       regenerate the metadata indices.
 * 
 * @todo A temporal/immortable database can be realized if we never delete old
 *       journals since they contain the historical committed states of the
 *       database. The use of index segments would still provide fast read
 *       performance on recent data, while a suitable twist on the metadata
 *       index would allow access to those historical states. (E.g., you have to
 *       be able to access the historical state of the metadata index that
 *       corresponds to the commit time of interest for the database.)
 * 
 * @todo support two-tier metadata index and reconcile with
 *       {@link MetadataIndex} and {@link MasterJournal}.
