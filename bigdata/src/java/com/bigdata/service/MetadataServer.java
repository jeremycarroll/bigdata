/**
 * A metadata server.
 * <p>
 * The metadata server is used to manage the life cycles of scale-out indices
 * and exposes proxies for read and write operations on indices to clients.
 * Clients use index proxies, which automatically direct reads and writes to the
 * {@link IDataService} on which specific index partitions are located.
 * <p>
 * On startup, the metadata service discovers active data services configured in
 * the same group. While running, it tracks when data services start and stop so
 * that it can (re-)allocate index partitions as necessary.
 * <p>
 * The metadata server uses a write through pipeline to replicate its data onto
 * registered secondary metadata servers. If the metadata server fails, clients
 * will automatically fail over to a secondary metadata server. Only the primary
 * metadata server actively tracks the state of data services since secondaries
 * are updated via the write through pipeline to ensure consistency. Secondary
 * metadata servers will notice if the primary dies and elect a new master.
 * 
 * @todo note that the service update registration is _persistent_ (assuming
 *       that the service registrar is persistent I suppose) so that will add a
 *       wrinkle to how a bigdata instance must be configured.
