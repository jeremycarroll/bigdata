/**
 * Abstract base class for a bigdata client.
 * <p>
 * Clients are configured to perform service lookup with a jini group that
 * identifies the bigdata federation. Clients begin by discovering the
 * {@link IMetadataService}. Clients use the {@link IMetadataService} to manage
 * scale-out indices (add/drop) and to obtain the {@link IDataService} that it
 * must talk to for any given partition of a scale-out index. Once a client has
 * the {@link IDataService} for an index partition, it carries out read and
 * write operations using that {@link IDataService}. An {@link IIndex} factory
 * is provided that hides the {@link IMetadataService} and {@link IDataService}
 * communications from the application. The {@link IIndex} objects provided by
 * the factory are responsible for transparently discovering the
 * {@link IDataService}s on which the index partitions are located and
 * directing read and write operations appropriately.
 * <p>
 * A client may discover and use an {@link ITransactionManager} if needs to use
 * transactions as opposed to unisolated reads and writes. When the client
 * requests a transaction, the transaction manager responds with a long integer
 * containing the transaction identifier - this is simply the unique start time
 * assigned to that transaction by the transaction manager. The client then
 * provides that transaction identifier for operations that are isolated within
 * the transaction. When the client is done with the transaction, it must use
 * the transaction manager to either abort or commit the transaction.
 * (Transactions that fail to progress may be eventually aborted.)
 * <p>
 * When using unisolated operations, the client does not need to resolve or use
 * the transaction manager and it simply specifies <code>0L</code> as the
 * transaction identifier for its read and write operations.
 * 
 * @todo if possible, reconcile index interfaces and a client interface such
 *       that a bigdata client application can use the same code regardless
 *       whether the client is embedded, uses jini, or uses another services
 *       architectre such as OSGi, WSDL, etc.
 * 
 * @todo write tests where an index is static partitioned over multiple data
 *       services and verify that the {@link ClientIndexView} is consistent.
 *       <p>
 *       Work towards the same guarentee when dynamic partitioning is enabled.
 * 
 * @todo support transactions (there is no transaction manager service yet and
 *       the 2-/3-phase commit protocol has not been implemented on the
 *       journal).
 * 
 * @todo Write or refactor logic to map operations across multiple partitions.
 * 
 * @todo reuse cached information across transactional and non-transactional
 *       views of the same index.
 * 
 * @todo Use lambda expressions (and downloaded code) for server-side logic for
 *       batch operations.
 * 
 * @todo support failover metadata service discovery.
 * 
 * @todo document client configuration, the relationship between jini groups and
 *       a bigdata federation, and whether and how a single client could connect
 *       to more than one bigdata federation.
 * 
 * @todo Use a weak-ref cache with an LRU (or hard reference cache) to retain
 *       cached {@link IPartitionMetadata}. The client needs access by {
 *       indexName, key } to obtain a {@link ServiceID} for a
 *       {@link DataService} and then needs to translate the {@link ServiceID}
 *       to a data service using the {@link #dataServiceMap}.
 * 
 * @see ClientIndexView
