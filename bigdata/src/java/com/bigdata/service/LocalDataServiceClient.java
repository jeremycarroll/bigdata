 * Client for a local (embedded) {@link DataService} exposed as an

 * scale-out {@link IBigdataFederation}s (but see below).
 * <p>
 * The {@link IDataService} provides full concurrency control and transaction
 * support, but there is no metadata index so all indices are monolithic (they
 * are never broken into key-range partitions).
 * <p>
 * Note: since all indices are stored within the same {@link IDataService} you
 * can write JOINs that enjoy certain optimizations by obtaining a lock on more
 * than one index at a time. Such JOINs must be written using
 * {@link AbstractTask} rather than {@link IIndexProcedure} since the latter
 * assumes access to a single index at a time. However, such code is not
 * portable to remote {@link IDataService}s nor to a federation that supports
 * key-range partitioned indices.
