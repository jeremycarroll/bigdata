<p>
This package provides implementations of bigdata services (metadata
service, data service, transaction manager service.
</p>

<p>
A bigdata federation is comprised of the following essential
services:

<dl>

<dt>metadata service</dt><dd>The metadata service manages indices and
 is used to locate index partitions.</dd>

<dt>data service</dt><dd>The data service supports reads and writes on
index partitions.</dd>

<dt>transaction manager service</dt><dd>Clients use the transaction
manager service to start new transactions and to coordinate the
distributed commit protocol.  The transaction manager also provides a
centralized timestamp factory.</dd>

</dl>

Clients are responsible for discovering the metadata service.  Clients
then use the metadata service to manage scale-out indices and to
locate and cache leases for data service instances having data for key
range partitions that the client will read or write.  If a client will
use transactions (vs ACID batch operations), then the client must also
locate the transaction manager service. Service location is performed
using JINI, but other service locator protocols are possible.
</p>

<p>

bigdata provides the following value added services.  These are not
considered essential since (a) they are not required by clients that
make direct use of bigdata as a distributed database; and (b) they are
themsevles applications of the services briefly described above.

<dl>

<dt>map/reduce service</dt><dd>Manages the distributed execution of a
functional program.</dd>

</dl>

</p>

<h2>deployment</h2>

<p>

In order to deploy a bigdata federation, the following preconditions
must be met (a standalone deployment can be realized by meeting these
preconditions on a single host).  This will go more smoothly if JINI
is running before you start the various bigdata services since they
will then be able to register themselves immediately on
startup. Service discovery by default uses the local network and the
"public" group. If you want to run more than one bigdata federation on
the same network, then you MUST edit the configuration file.

</p>

<p>
Hosts:

<ul>

<li>java 5 or better is installed.  The use of a server VM is highly
recommended.  The following options are recommended for some well
known VMs: <dl>

<dt>Sun</dt><dd>-server -Xms1g -Xmx1g -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=256M</dd>

<dt>JRockit</dt><dd>-Xms1g -Xmx1g</dd>

</dl>

@todo review the use of -Xms (sets the initial heap size).  How much
of a difference does this make?  Note that JRockit defaults to 75% of
physical memory or 1G, which ever is less.</li>

<li>the bigdata-server distribution is installed.</li>

<li>the data service is running.</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>
In addition, there must be at least one host on which the following
preconditions are true (a different host could be used for each of
these services, and more than one instance of these services may be
running on the network).  These services should be started during the
boot procedure so that they are available whenever the host is up and
running.

<ul>

<li>jini 2.x is installed and running.  This will be used to register
and lookup services.  It helps if jini is running before you try to
start the bigdata sercices since they will be able to register
themselves immediately in that case.</li>

<li>the metadata service is running (this is part of the
bigdata-server distribution).</li>

<li>the transaction manager service is running (this is part of the
bigdata-server distribution).</li>

<li>the optional map/reduce service is running (this is part of the
bigdata-server distribution).</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>
Clients:

<ul>

<li>java 5 or better is installed.  The use of a server VM
is highly recommended</li>

<li>the bigdata-client deployment package is installed.  This includes
bigdata-client.jar, but also support for generating unicode keys
(ICU4J), etc.</li>

</ul>

</p>

<h2>downloaded code</h2>

<p>

While bigdata makes use of jini for service registration and
discovery, it does not use downloaded code for executing its basic
services (the necessary interfaces and implementation classes are
already bundled in bigdata.jar). However, clients MAY use downloaded
code in order to have data servers execute remote procedures or
extension batch operations.  In this scenario, the client will create
and register a JINI service.  The service should perform <em>all</em>
of its operations locally.  The data server will lookup the service
using jini and then execute it locally.
</p>

<p>
In order for downloaded code to work correctly, clients must ensure
that their classes are exposed by an HTTP server accessible to bigdata
servers and declared to the VM in which the client starts using:
	  	
<code>-Djava.rmi.server.codebase=...</code>

</p>

<p>

@todo consider this use case further. Are there other/better ways for
executing remote code on the data server?  At a minimum, we should
supply a base class and ant script support for creating such remote
services.
