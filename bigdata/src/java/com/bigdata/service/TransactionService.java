/**
 * Centalized transaction manager service. In response to a client request, the
 * transaction manager will distribute prepare/commit or abort operations to all
 * data services on which writes were made by a transaction.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @see OldTransactionServer, which has lots of code and notes that bear on this
 *      implementation.
 * 
 * @todo robust/failover discoverable service.
 * 
 * @todo since data services can fail and start elsewhere, what we need to
 *       locate the data service is really the index name and key range (or
 *       perhaps the partition identifier) for the write. Based on that, we can
 *       always locate the correct data service instance. The
 *       {@link InetSocketAddress} is useful if we can invalidate it if the data
 *       service instance fails.
 * 
 * @todo test for transactions that have already been completed? that would
 *       represent a protocol error. we could maintain an LRU cache of completed
 *       transactions for this purpose.
 * 
 * @todo does the api need to be synchronized?
 * 
 * @todo track ground states so that we known when we can release old journals
 *       and index segments?
 * 
 * @todo the transactional model might include a counter for the #of clients
 *       that have started work on a transaction in order to support distributed
 *       start/commit protocols. if clients use a workflow model, then they
 *       could pass the responsibility for the counter along with the
 *       transaction identifier rather than decrementing the counter themselves.
 *       It might be good to be able to identify which clients are still working
 *       on a given transaction.
