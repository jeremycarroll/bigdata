/**
 * Data service interface.
 * <p>
 * The data service exposes the methods on this interface to the client and the
 * {@link ITxCommitProtocol} methods to the {@link ITransactionManager} service.
 * <p>
 * The data service exposes both isolated (transactional) and unisolated batch
 * operations on scalable named btrees. Transactions are identified by their
 * start time. BTrees are identified by name. The btree batch API provides for
 * existence testing, lookup, insert, removal, and an extensible mutation
 * operation. Other operations exposed by this interface include: remote
 * procedure execution, key range traversal, and mapping of an operator over a
 * key range.
 * <p>
 * Unisolated processing is broken down into idempotent operation (reads) and
 * mutation operations (insert, remove, the extensible batch operator, and
 * remote procedure execution).
 * <p>
 * Unisolated writes are serialized and ACID. If an unisolated write succeeds,
 * then it will commit immediately. If the unisolated write fails, the partial
 * write on the journal will be discarded.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo add support for triggers. unisolated triggers must be asynchronous if
 *       they will take actions with high latency (such as writing on a
 *       different index partition, which could be remote). Low latency actions
 *       might include emitting asynchronous messages. transactional triggers
 *       can have more flexibility since they are under less of a latency
 *       constraint.
 * 
 * @todo add protocol / service version information to this interface and
 *       provide for life switch-over from service version to service version so
 *       that you can update or rollback the installed service versions with
 *       100% uptime.
