/**
 * An implementation of a data service suitable for use with RPC, direct client
 * calls (if decoupled by an operation queue), or a NIO interface.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is thread-safe. It will block for each operation. It MUST
 * be invoked within a pool of request handler threads servicing a network
 * interface in order to decouple data service operations from client requests.
 * When using as part of an embedded database, the client operations MUST be
 * buffered by a thread pool with a FIFO policy so that client requests will be
 * decoupled from data service operations.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #txService} provides concurrency for transaction processing.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #opService} provides concurrency for unisolated reads.
 * <p>
 * Unisolated writes serialized using
 * {@link AbstractJournal#serialize(Callable)}.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @see NIODataService, which contains some old code that can be refactored for
 *      an NIO interface to the data service.
 * 
 * @todo add assertOpen() throughout
 * 
 * @todo declare interface for managing service shutdown()/shutdownNow()?
 * 
 * @todo support group commit for unisolated writes. i may have to refactor some
 *       to get group commit to work for both transaction commits and unisolated
 *       writes. basically, the tasks on the
 *       {@link AbstractJournal#writeService write service} need to get
 *       aggregated.
 * 
 * @todo implement NIODataService, RPCDataService(possible), EmbeddedDataService
 *       (uses queue to decouple operations), DataServiceClient (provides
 *       translation from {@link ISimpleBTree} to {@link IBatchBTree}, provides
 *       transparent partitioning of batch operations, handles handshaking and
 *       leases with the metadata index locator service; abstract IO for
 *       different client platforms (e.g., support PHP, C#). Bundle ICU4J with
 *       the client.
 * 
 * @todo JobScheduler service for map/reduce (or Hadoop integration).
 * 
 * @todo another data method will need to be defined to support GOM with
 *       pre-fetch. the easy way to do this is to get 50 objects to either side
 *       of the object having the supplied key. This is easy to compute using
 *       the {@link ILinearList} interface. I am not sure about unisolated
 *       operations for GOM.... Isolated operations are straight forward. The
 *       other twist is supporting scalable link sets, link set indices (not
 *       named, unless the identity of the object collecting the link set is
 *       part of the key), and non-OID indices (requires changes to
 *       generic-native).
 * 
 * @todo Have the {@link DataService} notify the transaction manager when a
 *       write is performed on that service so that all partitipating
 *       {@link DataService} instances will partitipate in a 2-/3-phase commit
 *       (and a simple commit can be used when the transaction write set is
 *       localized on a single dataservice instance). The message needs to be
 *       synchronous each time a new index partition is written on by the client
 *       so that the transaction manager can locate the primary
 *       {@link DataService} instance for the write when it needs to commit or
 *       abort the tx.

     *       a protocol among themselves for this purpose, we can simply
     *       maintain a mapping of transactions to threads. If a transaction is
     *       currently bound to a thread (its callable task is executing) then
     *       the current thread must wait. This protocol can be easily
     *       implemented using thread local variables.<br>
     *       Note: it is possible for this protocol to result in large numbers
     *       of worker threads blocking, but as long as each worker thread makes
     *       progress it should not be possible for the thread pool as a whole
     *       to block.
