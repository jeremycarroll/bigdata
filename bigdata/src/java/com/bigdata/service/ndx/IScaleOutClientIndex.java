     * <p>
     * The returned buffer provides a streaming API which is highly efficient if
     * you do not need to have synchronous notification or directly consume the
     * returned values. The caller writes ordered {@link KVO}[] chunks onto the
     * {@link BlockingBuffer}. Those chunks are dynamically combined and then

     * managed {@link BlockingBuffer}s for each index partition which will be
     * touched by a write operation. The splits are are slices of ordered chunks
     * for a specific index partition. The {@link BlockingBuffer} uses a merge
     * sort when it combines ordered chunks so that the combined chunks remain
     * fully ordered. Once a chunk is ready, it is re-shaped for the CTOR and
     * sent to the target data service using RMI.
     * <p>
     * {@link BlockingBuffer#getFuture()} may be used to obtain the
     * {@link Future} of the consumer. You can use {@link Future#get()} to await
     * the completion of the consumer, to cancel the consumer, etc. The
     * {@link Future} will not terminate (other than by error) until the buffer
     * has been {@link IBlockingBuffer#close() closed}. The {@link Future}
     * evaluates to an {@link IndexAsyncWriteStats} object. Those statistics are
     * also reported to the {@link ILoadBalancerService} via the
     * {@link IBigdataFederation}.
     * <p>
     * Note: Each buffer returned by this method is independent. However, all
     * the performance counters for all asynchronous write buffers for a given
     * client and scale-out index are aggregated by an
     * {@link ScaleOutIndexCounters}.

     * @param <R>
     *            The type of the result from applying the index procedure to a
     *            single {@link Split} of data.
     * @param <A>
     *            The type of the aggregated result.

     *            Used to filter out duplicates in an application specified
     *            manner (optional). A duplicate remover MUST NOT be used to
     *            eliminate duplicates in combination with {@link KVOC} and
     *            {@link KVOLatch}. If a {@link KVOC} having the same key,
     *            value, and ref but a distinct {@link KVOLatch} reference is
     *            eliminated as a duplicate that would cause a
     *            {@link KVOLatch#dec()} invocation to be "lost" and would
     *            result in non-termination since the count for the "lost" latch
     *            would never reach zero.
     * 
     * @param ctor
     *            Used to create instances of the procedure that will execute a
     *            write on an individual index partition (this implies that
     *            insert and remove operations as well as custom index write
     *            operations must use separate buffers).

     * @return A buffer on which the producer may write their data.

     * @todo The async API is only defined at this time for scale-out index
     *       views. An asynchronous write API could be defined for local
     *       B+Trees. It would have to ensure locks using the
     *       {@link UnisolatedReadWriteIndex}. It would not use the same
     *       layering since writes could not be scattered. It could be written
     *       as a single blocking buffer which was drained by the CTOR for the
     *       operation. If we combine the two buffer capacity parameters into a
     *       single parameter, then this method signature could be used for both
     *       local and scale-out index views. This method could then be moved to
     *       an IAsynchronousIndexWriter interface.
