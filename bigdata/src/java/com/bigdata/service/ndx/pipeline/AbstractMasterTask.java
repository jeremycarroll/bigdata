     * <ul>
     * 
     * <li>The client writes on the top-level {@link BlockingBuffer} while an
     * index partition write is asynchronously handling a
     * {@link StaleLocatorException}. This could cause a problem because we may
     * be required to (re-)open an {@link IndexPartitionWriteTask}.</li>
     * 
     * <li>The client has closed the top-level {@link BlockingBuffer} but there
     * are still writes buffered for the individual index partitions. This could
     * cause a problem since we must wait until those buffered writes have been
     * flushed. We can not simply monitor the remaining values in
     * {@link #subtasks} since {@link StaleLocatorException}s could cause new
     * {@link IndexPartitionWriteTask} to start.</li>
     * 
     * <li>...</li>
     * 
     * </ul>
     * 
     * The {@link #lock} is therefore used to make the following operations
     * mutually exclusive while allowing them to complete:
     * <dl>
     * <dt>{@link #addToOutputBuffer(Split, KVO[], boolean)}</dt>
     * <dd>Adding data to an output blocking buffer.</dd>
     * <dt>{@link #handleStaleLocator(IndexPartitionWriteTask, KVO[], StaleLocatorException)}</dt>
     * <dd>Handling a {@link StaleLocatorException}, which may require
     * (re-)opening an {@link IndexPartitionWriteTask} even during
     * {@link #awaitAll()}.</dd>
     * <dt>{@link #cancelAll()}</dt>
     * <dd>Cancelling the task and its subtask(s).</dd>
