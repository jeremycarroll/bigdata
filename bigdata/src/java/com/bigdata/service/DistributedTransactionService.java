     *       operations (non-transactional commits). The selected timestamp will
     *       always be coherent with respect to transaction commits since those
     *       are coordinated and use a shared commit time.
     *       <p>
     *       This issue can only arise when requesting historical reads for

     *       <p>
     *       Simply stated, there is NO protection against concurrently
     *       unisolated operations committing. If such operations are used on
     *       the same indices as transactions, then it IS possible that the

     *       until the unisolated commit notices have been propagated to the
     *       {@link DistributedTransactionService}. This issue will only occur
     *       when there is also a lot of contention for reading on the desired
