/**
 * A interface for a service using a job and task model. The service may have
 * many clients, and each client may start jobs and execute tasks within running
 * jobs. A job must be started before tasks may be submitted. Tasks run with
 * some unknown concurrency. The service MUST be sent a heartbeat for each job
 * to keep tasks running in that job. The heartbeat returns the #of completed
 * tasks for that job. The client can drain the completed tasks for a job,
 * transferring information about their {@link Outcome} to itself. A pending or
 * running task may be cancelled, in which case it will show up as completed
 * (with {@link Status#Cancelled}). If the service does not receive several
 * heatbeats in a row for a job, then it will cancel the job and all tasks
 * running in that job. When the client is done executing tasks for a job, it
 * should cancel the job. When a job is cancelled, all state for that job is
 * thrown away.
 * <p>
 * Note: This interface extends {@link Remote} since it may be used as a remote
 * service. Per the contract of the {@link Remote} interface, methods on this
 * interface are declared to throw {@link IOException} since they may be invoked
 * by RMI.
 * 
 * @param <M>
 *            The type for the job metadata parameter in
 *            {@link #startJob(UUID, Object)}.
 * @param <T>
 *            The type for the task in {@link #submit(UUID, Object)}.
 * 
 * @todo add a status message returning a String containing a service specific
 *       status summary.
