/**
 * An instance of this class is used to absorb writes on a {@link DataService}
 * for each index partition mapped onto that data service. The class extends
 * {@link UnisolatedBTree} to carry additional metadata for a specific index
 * partition (the partition identifier, left- and right-separator keys, etc).
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo write tests for restart safety of the partition metadata.
 * 
 * @todo provide optional range checking on keys.
 * 
 * FIXME The {@link UnisolatedBTree} is named according to a convention such as
 * "name#partitionId" (since this is a key it would be nice if the btree name
 * came across as an unsigned byte[] so that we can use the same key formation
 * conventions, but that will make error messages more cryptic since there will
 * only be the compressed sort key and the index UUID available locally).
 * <p>
 * If I extend the btree metadata record then I can include a fromKey/toKey
 * constraint and the rest of the partition metadata right there. The only
 * awkward bit then is the named indices map on overflow. We need the partition
 * metadata in order to know which journal resources and index segments comprise
 * the view of the partition. If that is only stored locally in the btree
 * metadata record, then we need to create a new btree each time we overflow the
 * journal. For this purpose, it would be nice if we did not have to write out
 * the empty root leaf as well. This means that on overflow of a journal with
 * 1000 mapped index partitions, that we need to create 1000 btree metadata
 * records just in case there is a write on any of those partitions - and to be
 * able to recovered the global metadata index from the local state. Of couse,
 * writing a 1000 records on the journal is insanely fast so this could be no
 * problem at all. Having the partition metadata for mapped index partitions
 * available locally also means that we do not need to do a network operation in
 * order to validate that a partition was mapped onto the {@link DataService}.
 * <p>
 * Another advantage of this approach is that we can create a thread pool for
 * index writers where the pool size is configured to limit the #of concurrent
 * writers to those sustainable by the host. Since each index partition is now a
 * distinct btree, we can write on any number of distinct index partitions
 * concurrently (up to the size of the thread pool). This could be great for a
 * many-core platform. Selecting operations to execute will require a
 * specialized executor service that tends to be fair but never chooses two
 * writes on the same index partition for concurrent execution (ie., the first
 * write for an index partition that is not currently being written on).
