/**
 * <p>
 * A client-side view of a scale-out index as of some <i>timestamp</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This variant is a refactor which automatically aggregates writes for an index
 * partition using resource queues. This gives better throughput when writes are
 * scattered across more than a handfull of index partitions. Throughput is
 * improved for several reasons: (a) fewer threads are required since the client
 * will never issue more than one concurrent write request per index partition;
 * (b) writes are automatically aggregated, resulting in larger writes as the
 * system becomes more heavily loaded; (c) the clients effectively self-throttle
 * the write requests so the data services never have more than one concurrent
 * write request per client per index partition on the data service; and (d) if
 * an index partition is split / moved / joined, then the client must re-issue
 * at most ONE write request since it only submits a single request per index
 * partition at a time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This view automatically handles the split, join, or move of index partitions
 * within the federation. The {@link IDataService} throws back a (sometimes
 * wrapped) {@link StaleLocatorException} when it does not have a registered
 * index as of some timestamp. If this exception is observed when the client
 * makes a request using a cached {@link PartitionLocator} record then the
 * locator record is stale. The client automatically fetches the locator
 * record(s) covering the same key range as the stale locator record and the
 * re-issues the request against the index partitions identified in those
 * locator record(s). This behavior correctly handles index partition split,
 * merge, and move scenarios. The implementation of this policy is limited to
 * exactly three places in the code: {@link AbstractDataServiceProcedureTask},
 * {@link PartitionedTupleIterator}, and {@link DataServiceTupleIterator}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that only {@link ITx#UNISOLATED} and {@link ITx#READ_COMMITTED}
 * operations are subject to stale locators since they are not based on a
 * historical committed state of the database. Historical read and
 * fully-isolated operations both read from historical committed states and the
 * locators are never updated for historical states (only the current state of
 * an index partition is split, joined, or moved - the historical states always
 * remain behind).
 * </p>
 * 
 * @todo add resource queues.
 *       <p>
 *       There is going to be an interaction with how stale locators are
 *       handled.
 *       <p>
 *       Read-only operations could be sent with greater concurrency, but if
 *       they are read-only operations for the unisolated index then we could
 *       have stale locators so maybe greater concurrency should be limited to
 *       read-only index views.
 *       <p>
 *       Some tasks are not parallelizable. For those cases the caller needs to
 *       wait until the previous subtask is complete before a new task can be
 *       submitted.
 *       <p>
 *       If the {@link AbstractDataServiceProcedureTask} is in the base class
 *       then I can just override {@link #runTasks(boolean, ArrayList)} and be
 *       done with it. However, the concrete implementations of the tasks will
 *       need to differ in how they handle resubmits of the tasks.
 *       <p>
 *       In fact, I can leave in {@link #getRecursionDepth()} but simply ignore
 *       it in {@link #runTasks(boolean, ArrayList)}.
 *       <p>
 *       The right way to abstract this is by defining an {@link Executor}, but
 *       {@link #runTasks(boolean, ArrayList)} is basically just that. What it
 *       needs to do for this varient is place the tasks onto the appropriate
 *       resource queues, which needs to be an atomic operation. Inside of that
 *       operation, a task is submitted immediately if it is at the head of the
 *       queue (in which case the queue was empty and will now contain only the
 *       one task which is being executed). Otherwise the task will wait in the
 *       queue until the task which is currently at the head of the queue
 *       returns. That suggests that we need to examine the queues atomically
 *       when each task completes. We remove the task at the head of the queue
 *       (the one use {@link Future} is now complete) and examine the queue. if
 *       it is empty, then we go onto the next future. Otherwise we aggregate
 *       the tasks in the queue into a single task and send it along to the data
 *       service.
 *       <p>
 *       So, separate out the aggregation logic from the logic to submit the
 *       tasks so I can try to "intrinsically" aggregate tasks where the same
 *       operation was requested? No, that seems way too difficult. Just place
 *       them into a "combined" task and send that along. But how do the futures
 *       get back for the individual tasks? Ungh. And what about having
 *       read-only operations mixed in there? And a read-only index view should
 *       not bother with this logic.
 *       <p>
 *       Why not use an unlimited thread pool on the client and scatter tasks on
 *       split? This is a pretty rare event.
 *       <p>
 *       If all of this is limited to {@link #runTasks(boolean, ArrayList)} then
 *       that can be an interface and I can just provide different
 *       implementations of that interface.

             * reaches the head of its resource queue).
             *

             * (it waits for a task to hold all of its locks when these tasks
             * are independent; each task sits in a single resource queue and
             * can execute as soon as it reaches the head of that queue).
             * 
             * @todo the lock services DOES NOT handle aggregation of tasks (the
             * rolling up of other tasks into the queue into a single task
             * either by wrapping them in a meta-task or by literally re-writing
             * the task as one with the same task ctor but having more data).
             * 
             * @todo So, clone the lock service and produce a purpose specific
             * class that we will use here.
             * 
             * @todo The point (byte[] key) and key-range (byte[] fromKey,
             * byte[] toKey) tasks can be "aggregated" by combining them within
             * in meta-task which is executed against the remote data service,
             * or they could just be submitted individually or using invokeAll()
             * (which might not be as good since the futures would otherwise
             * arrive incrementally). There is some opportunity for eliminating
             * identical requests, but how common is that?
             * 
             * @todo The AbstractIndexProcedureConstructor is only used for the
             * (byte[][] key, byte[][] val) variants. Those are precisely the
             * ones that we want to aggregate. See the
             * KeyArrayDataServiceProcedureTask. The ctors would have to be
             * "equals" to be combined, not just instances of the same ctor
             * class.
             * 
             * @todo The KeyArray procedures are the one that can be aggregated.
             * That can be accomplished by a merge sort of the data for the
             * individual procedures.
             * 
             * @todo The tasks in the queue would still need to have their
             * futures complete and the data would have to be reverse mapped
             * onto the original tasks which raises some hairy questions about
             * the IResultHandler. Arrgh! I can't see any way to handle the
             * reverse credit assignment for tasks such as SPOWriteProc which
             * return the #of tuples which were modified.
             * 
             * @todo If I can't rewrite the tasks using a merge sort then the
             * only benefits of this approach are going to be: (1) the use of
             * fewer threads on the client (no more than one per index partition
             * for writes); (2) clients will self-throttle; (3) fewer tasks will
             * be invalidated when a stale locator exception is thrown.
             * 
             * @todo I was really looking for the impact on the request size
             * (more data in the request) and the consequent improvement in the
             * caching when the request executes.
             * 
             * Maybe there is another way to refactor the data write paradigm
             * for better throughput. Perhaps in terms of the "relation" on
             * which the write is takening place.
             * 
             * This would be easier to think about as pure data. It is the
             * requirement to know how many tuples were modified that is killing
             * me. I believe that this requirement was driven by the fix point
             * closure logic, so maybe there is a way to handle that
             * differently. At that point, a write is a write and could be
             * aggregated.
             * 
             * @see AbstractSolutionBuffer, which notes a 20:1 performance win
             *      for combining chunks together for scale-out JOINs.
             * 
             * @see IMutableRelation; if it returned a boolean then the fixed
             *      point logic would still be Ok.
             * 
             * So this seems workable for both raw writes and custom writes
             * which are only returning a mutation count, even if it does have a
             * lot of consequences for the API in various places.
             * 
             * @todo If I can work this out, then I could also apply the
             * aggregation to requests from different clients on the service,
             * which might be a good time to refactor the AbstractTask and the
             * group commit logic and get distributed commits working.
