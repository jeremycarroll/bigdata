/**
 * A draft implementation of a map/reduce service. Map/reduce is a functional
 * programming style in which a program is broken down into a <i>map</i> and a
 * <i>reduce</i> operation. Those operations are trivially parallelized and
 * distributed across one or more worker tasks on available hosts. There will be
 * M map tasks and N reduce tasks for each map/reduce operation.
 * <p>
 * The inputs to the map operation are key-value pairs. Logicall, each map
 * operation processes a key-value pair, writing a set of intermediate key-value
 * pairs as its output. The outputs are automatically partitioned into N local
 * temporary files (one per reduce task) using a user-defined hash function.
 * <p>
 * Each reduce task reads from the M distinct files (one per map operation)
 * having data for the intermediate key-value partition assigned to that reduce
 * task. The keys in those partitions are essentially random since they are
 * assigned to partitions by the (user-defined) hash function. Before execution,
 * the reduce task inputs are placed into a total order, e.g., using a sort or
 * bulk index load. The reduce task is then run on the total order, writing its
 * outputs onto a single output file. There will be one such output file per
 * reduce task.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo the reduce output is written to an arbitrary sink. common uses are
 *       probably a NOP (the N merged indices are the outputs) a 2nd stage
 *       reduce (producing a total merge of the intermediate values) or various
 *       kinds of local flat files.
 * 
 * @todo the master needs to keep track of the state each worker task on each
 *       host.
 * 
 * @todo the master needs a queue for input jobs and should expose an HTML
 *       monitor for job status, as well as email notification of results.
 * 
 * @todo The Apache Hadoop project provides a MapReduce implementation. Explore
 *       possible ways in which an integration could be achieved.
 * 
 * @todo support "debugging" using a version that executes tasks for a single
 *       partition of subset of the data.
