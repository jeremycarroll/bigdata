/**
 * The {@link ResourceManager} is responsible for locating, opening, closing
 * managed resources (journals and index segements), for providing views of an
 * index partition, and integrates concurrency controls such that you can run
 * procedures against either individual indices or index views. In addition,
 * this class provides event reporting for resources and facilitates resource
 * transfer for the distributed database architecture.
 * <p>
 * This class is responsible for integrating events that report on resource
 * consumption and latency and taking actions that may seek to minimize latency
 * or resource consumption.
 * <p>
 * Resource consumption events include
 * <ol>
 * <li>mutable unisolated indices open on the journal</li>
 * <li>mutable isolated indices open in writable transactions</li>
 * <li>historical read-only indices open on old journals</li>
 * <li>historical read-only index segments</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * The latter two classes of event sources exist iff {@link Journal#overflow()}
 * is handled by creating a new {@link Journal} and evicting data from the old
 * {@link Journal} asynchronously onto read-optimized {@link IndexSegment}s.
 * 
 * Other resource consumption events deal directly with transactions
 * <ol>
 * <li>open a transaction</li>
 * <li>close a transaction</li>
 * <li>a heartbeat for each write operation on a transaction is used to update
 * the resource consumption of the store</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Latency events include
 * <ol>
 * <li>request latency, that is, the time that a request waits on a queue
 * before being serviced</li>
 * <li>transactions per second</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * @todo update javadoc.
 * 
 * @todo recommend setting the
 *       {@link com.bigdata.journal.Options#INITIAL_EXTENT} to the
 *       {@link com.bigdata.journal.Options#MAXIMUM_EXTENT} in minimize the
 *       likelyhood of having to extend the journal and in order to keep the
 *       allocation size on the file system large to minimize fragmentation?
 *       <p>
 *       Also, consider moving the target journal size up to 500M.
 * 
 * @todo track the disk space used by the {@link #getDataDir()} and the free
 *       space remaining on the mount point that hosts the data directory. if we
 *       approach the limit on the space in use then we need to shed index
 *       partitions to other data services or potentially become more aggressive
 *       in releasing old resources.
 * 
 * @todo The choice of the #of offset bits governs both the maximum #of records
 *       (indirectly through the maximum byte offset) and the maximum record
 *       length (directly).
 *       <p>
 *       A scale-up deployment based on a {@link ResourceManager} can address a
 *       very large index either by using more offset bits and never overflowing
 *       the journal or by using fewer offset bits and a series of journals and
 *       migrating data off of the journals onto index segments. Since there is
 *       no {@link MetadataIndex} the cost of a full compacting merge for an
 *       index grows as a function of the total index size. This makes full
 *       compacting merges increasingly impractical for large indices.
 *       <p>
 *       However, a scale-out deployment based on an {@link IBigdataFederation}
 *       supports key-range partitioned indices regardless of whether it is an
 *       {@link EmbeddedBigdataFederation} or a distributed federation. This
 *       means that the cost of a full compacting merge for an index partition
 *       is capped by the size limits we place on index partitions regardless of
 *       the total size of the scale-out index.
 * 
 * @todo Transparent promotion of unpartitioned indices to indicate that support
 *       delete markers and can therefore undergo {@link #overflow()}. This is
 *       done by defining one partition that encompases the entire legal key
 *       range and setting the resource metadata for the view.
 *       <p>
 *       Transparent promotion of indices to support delete markers on
 *       {@link #overflow()}? We don't need to maintain delete markers until
 *       the first overflow event....
 *       <P>
 *       Do NOT break the ability to use concurrency control on unpartitioned
 *       indices -- note that overflow handling will only work on that support
 *       deletion markers.
 * 
 * @todo Scale-out import and index recovery
 *       <p>
 *       Note that key range partitioned indices are simply registered under a
 *       name that reflects both the scale-out index name and the index
 *       partition#. The metadata index provides the integrating structure for
 *       those individual index partitions. A {@link ClientIndexView} uses the
 *       {@link MetadataIndex} to provide transparent access to the scale-out
 *       index.
 *       <p>
 *       It should be possible to explicitly convert an index that supports
 *       delete markers into a scale-out index. The right model might be to
 *       "import" the index into an existing federation since there needs to be
 *       an explicit {@link MetadataService} on hand. There will only be a
 *       single partition of the index initially, but that can be broken down
 *       either because it is too large or because it becomes too large. The
 *       import can be realized by moving all of the data off of the journal
 *       onto one or more {@link IndexSegment}s, moving those index segment
 *       files into a selected data service, and then doing an "index recovery"
 *       operation that hooks up the index segment(s) into an index and
 *       registers the metadata index for that index. (Note that we can't make
 *       an index into a key-range partitioned index unless there is a metadata
 *       index lying around somewhere.)
 *       <p>
 *       Work through a federated index recovery where we re-generate the
 *       metadata index from the on hand data services.
 * 
 * FIXME review use of synchronization and make sure that there is no way in
 * which we can double-open a store or index.
 * 
 * @todo refactor logging calls into uses of a {@link ResourceManager} instance?
 * 
 * @todo use {@link MDC} to put metadata into the logging context {thread, host,
 *       dataService, global index name, local index name (includes the index
 *       partition), etc}.
 * 
 * @todo Use a hard reference queue to track recently used AbstractBTrees (and
 *       stores?). Add a public referenceCount field on AbstractBTree and close
 *       the AbstractBTree on eviction from the hard reference queue iff the
 *       referenceCount is zero (no references to that AbstractBTree remain on
 *       the hard reference queue).
 * 
 * @todo re-examine the caching for B+Trees from the perspective of the
 *       {@link ResourceManager}. Ideally a checkpoint operation will not
 *       discard the per-btree node / leaf cache (the write retention and/or
 *       read retention queues). Equally, it would be nice if read-committed and
 *       historical reads for "hot" points (such as the lastCommitTime of the
 *       old journal or an intensive tx) were able to benefit from a read-cache
 *       at the node/leaf or record level. Also, note that {@link IndexSegment}s
 *       may be reused in a number of views, e.g., both the unisolated and
 *       read-committed view of an index, but that all of those views share the
 *       same {@link IndexSegment} instance and hence the same read cache. This
 *       makes it worth while to fully buffer the nodes of the index segment,
 *       but since the branching factor is larger the write/read retention queue
 *       should be smaller.
 * 
 * @todo Consider the use of an inner class to impose read-only semantics on a
 *       BTree in {@link #getIndex(String, long)} or
 *       {@link #getIndexOnStore(String, long, IRawStore)} so that the result
 *       will still be a BTree but it will not be mutable. This is just extract
 *       protection against attempts to write on historical views. Since the
 *       IndexSegment is always read-only we do not have to anything for that
 *       case.
 * 
 * @todo consider handling close out of index partitions "whole at once" to
 *       include all index segments in the current view of that partition. this
 *       probably does not matter but might be a nicer level of aggregation than
 *       the individual index segment. It's easy enough to identify the index
 *       segments from the btree using the partition metadata record. However,
 *       it is harder to go the other way (and in fact impossible since the same
 *       index segment can be used in multiple index partition views as the
 *       partition definition evolves - in contrast 1st btree in the index
 *       partition view always has the current partition metadata description
 *       and therefore could be used to decrement the usage counters on the
 *       other components of that view (but not to directly close them out)).
 * 
 * @todo this still does not suggest a mechanism for close by timeout. one
 *       solutions is to just close down all open indices if the server quieses.
 *       if the server is not quiesent then unused indices will get shutdown in
 *       any case (this is basically how we are closing btrees and index
 *       segments now, so they remain available but release their resources).

     *       and track the #of instances of each {@link AbstractBTree} on the
     *       queue using #referenceCount and "touch()", perhaps in Name2Addr;
     *       write tests. consider one queue for mutable btrees and another for
     *       index segments, partitioned indices, metadata indices, etc.
     *       consider the meaning of "queue length" here and how to force close
     *       based on timeout. improve reporting of index segments by name and
     *       partition.<br>
     *       Mutable indices are low-cost to close/open. Closing them once they
     *       are no longer receiving writes can release some large buffers and
     *       reduce the latency of commits since dirty nodes will already have
     *       been flushed to disk. The largest cost on re-open is de-serializing
     *       nodes and leaves for subsequent operations. Those nodes will be
     *       read from a fully buffered store, so the latency will be small even
     *       though deserialization is CPU intensive. <br>
     *       Close operations on unisolated indices need to be queued in the
     *       {@link #writeService} so that they are executed in the same thread
     *       as other operations on the unisolated index.<br>
     *       Make sure that we close out old {@link Journal}s that are no
     *       longer required by any open index. This will require a distinct
     *       referenceCount on the {@link Journal}.
