/**
 * Splits the tail of an index partition and optionally submits a task to move
 * the tail to a target data service specified by the caller.
 * <p>
 * The split point is choosen by locating the right-most non-leaf node. The key
 * range which would enter that node is placed within the new right-sibling
 * index partition. The rest of the key range is placed within the new
 * left-sibling index partition.
 * <p>
 * The tail split operation is extremely fast since it only redefines the index
 * partitions. However, it require RMI to the metadata index to do that and
 * therefore should not be done during synchronous overflow in order to reduce
 * the possibility for errors during that operation.
 * <p>
 * The right-sibling of tail split is a prime candidate for a move since there
 * is an expectation that it will continue to be hot for writes. Therefore the
 * caller has an opportunity when specifying a tail split to also specify that
 * the new right-sibling index partition will be moved onto a caller specified
 * data service.
 * 
 * @todo unit tests.
