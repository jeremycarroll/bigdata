/**
 * Examine the named indices defined on the journal identified by the
 * <i>lastCommitTime</i> and, for each named index registered on that journal,
 * determines which of the following conditions applies and then schedules any
 * necessary tasks based on that decision:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Build a new {@link IndexSegment} for an existing index partition - this
 * is essentially a compacting merge (build).</li>
 * <li>Split an index partition into N index partitions (overflow).</li>
 * <li>Join N index partitions into a single index partition (underflow).</li>
 * <li>Move an index partition to another data service (redistribution). The
 * decision here is made on the basis of (a) underutilized nodes elsewhere; and
 * (b) overutilization of this node.</li>
 * <li>Nothing. This option is selected when (a) synchronous overflow
 * processing choose to copy the index entries from the old journal onto the new
 * journal (this is cheaper when the index has not absorbed many writes); and
 * (b) the index partition is not identified as the source for a move.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Each task has two phases
 * <ol>
 * <li>historical read from the lastCommitTime of the old journal</li>
 * <li>unisolated task performing an atomic update of the index partition view
 * and the metadata index</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Processing is divided into two stages:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>{@link #chooseTasks()}</dt>
 * <dd>This stage examines the named indices and decides what action (if any)
 * will be applied to each index partition.</dd>
 * <dt>{@link #runTasks()}</dt>
 * <dd>This stage reads on the historical state of the named index partitions,
 * building, splitting, joining, or moving their data as appropriate. When each
 * task is finished, it submits and awaits the completion of an
 * {@link AbstractAtomicUpdateTask}. The atomic update tasks run using
 * {@link ITx#UNISOLATED} operations on the live journal to make atomic updates
 * to the index partition definitions and to the {@link MetadataService} and/or
 * a remote data service where necessary</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * Note: This task is invoked after an
 * {@link ResourceManager#overflow(boolean, boolean)}. It is run on the
 * {@link ResourceManager}'s {@link ExecutorService} so that its execution is
 * asynchronous with respect to the {@link IConcurrencyManager}. While it does
 * not require any locks for some of its processing stages, this task relies on
 * the {@link ResourceManager#overflowAllowed} flag to disallow additional
 * overflow operations until it has completed. The various actions taken by this
 * task are submitted as submits tasks to the {@link IConcurrencyManager} so
 * that they will obtain the appropriate locks as necessary on the named
 * indices.
 * 
 * @todo consider side-effects of post-processing tasks (build, split, join, or
 *       move) on a distributed index rebuild operation. It is possible that
 *       the new index partitions may have been defined (but not yet registered
 *       in the metadata index) and that new index resources (on journals or
 *       index segment files) may have been defined. However, none of these
 *       operations should produce incoherent results so it should be possible
 *       to restore a coherent state of the metadata index by picking and
 *       choosing carefully. The biggest danger is choosing a new index
 *       partition which does not yet have all of its state on hand, but we have
 *       the {@link LocalPartitionMetadata#getSourcePartitionId()} which
 *       captures that.
 * 
 * @todo if an index partition is moved (or split or joined) while an active
 *       transaction has a write set for that index partition on a data service
 *       then we may need to move (or split and move) the transaction write set
 *       before it can be validated.
 * 
 * @todo its possible to play "catch up" on a "hot for write" index by copying
 *       behind the commit point on the live journal to the target journal in
 *       order to minimize the duration of the unisolated operation that handles
 *       the atomic cut over of the index to its new host. it might also be
 *       possible to duplicate the writes on the new host while they continue to
 *       be absorbed on the old host, but it would seem to be difficult to get
 *       the conditions just right for that.

    /**
     * Examine each named index on the old journal and decide what, if anything,
     * to do with that index. These indices are key range partitions of named

     * <p>
     * 
     * <h2> Compacting Merge </h2>
     * 
     * A compacting merge is performed when there are buffered writes, when the
     * buffered writes were not simply copied onto the new journal during the
     * atomic overflow operation, when the index partition is neither
     * overcapacity (split) nor undercapacity (joined), and when the #of source
     * index components for the index partition exceeds some threshold (~4).
     * Also, we do not do a build if the index partitions will be moved.
     * 
     * <h2> Incremental Build </h2>
     * 
     * A incremental build is performed when there are buffered writes, when the
     * buffered writes were not simply copied onto the new journal during the
     * atomic overflow operation, when the index partition is neither
     * overcapacity (split) nor undercapacity (joined), and when there are fewer
     * than some threshold (~4) #of components in the index partition view.
     * Also, we do not do a build if the index partitions will be moved.
     * <p>
     * An incremental build is generally faster than a compacting merge because
     * it only copies those writes that were buffered on the mutable
     * {@link BTree}. However, an incremental build must copy ALL tuples,
     * including deleted tuples, so it can do more work and does not cause the
     * rangeCount() to be reduced since the deleted tuples are preserved.
     * 
     * <h2> Split </h2>
     * 
     * A split is considered when an index partition appears to be overcapacity.
     * The split operation will inspect the index partition in more detail when
     * it runs. If the index partition does not, in fact, have sufficient
     * capacity to warrant a split then a build will be performed instead (the
     * build is treated more or less as a one-to-one split, but we do not assign
     * a new partition identifier). An index partition which is WAY overcapacity
     * can be split into more than 2 new index partitions.
     * 
     * <h2> Join </h2>
     * 
     * A join is considered when an index partition is undercapacity. Joins
     * require both an undercapacity index partition and its rightSibling. Since
     * the rightSeparatorKey for an index partition is also the key under which
     * the rightSibling would be found, we use the rightSeparatorKey to lookup
     * the rightSibling of an index partition in the {@link MetadataIndex}. If
     * that rightSibling is local (same {@link ResourceManager}) then we will
     * JOIN the index partitions. Otherwise we will MOVE the undercapacity index
     * partition to the {@link IDataService} on which its rightSibling was
     * found.
     * 
     * <h2> Move </h2>
     * 
     * We move index partitions around in order to make the use of CPU, RAM and
     * DISK resources more even across the federation and prevent hosts or data
     * services from being either under- or over-utilized. Index partition moves
     * are necessary when a scale-out index is relatively new in to distribute
     * the index over more than a single data service. Likewise, index partition
     * moves are important when a host is overloaded, especially when it is
     * approaching resource exhaustion. However, index partition moves DO NOT
     * release DISK space on a host since only the current state of the index
     * partition is moved, not its historical states (which are on a mixture of
     * journals and index segments).
     * <p>
     * We can choose which index partitions to move fairly liberally. Cold index
     * partitions are not consuming any CPU/RAM/IO resources and moving them to
     * another host will not effect the utilization of either the source or the
     * target host. Moving an index partition which is "hot for write" can
     * impose a noticable latency because the "hot for write" partition will
     * have absorbed more writes on the journal while we are moving the data
     * from the old view and we will need to move those writes as well. When we
     * move those writes the index will be unavailable for write until it
     * appears on the target data service. Therefore we generally choose to move
     * "warm" index partitions since it will introduce less latency when we
     * temporarily suspend writes on the index partition.
     * <p>
     * Indices typically have many commit points, and any one of them could
     * become "hot for read". However, moving an index partition is not going to
     * reduce the load on the old node for historical reads since we only move
     * the current state of the index, not its history. Nodes that are hot for
     * historical reads spots should be handled by increasing its replication
     * count and reading from the secondary data services. Note that
     * {@link ITx#READ_COMMITTED} and {@link ITx#UNISOLATED} both count against
     * the "live" index - read-committed reads always track the most recent
     * state of the index partition and would be moved if the index partition
     * was moved.
     * <p>
     * Bottom line: if a node is hot for historical read then increase the
     * replication count and read from failover services. If a node is hot for
     * read-committed and unisolated operations then move one or more of the
     * warm read-committed/unisolated index partitions to a node with less
     * utilization.
     * <p>
     * Index partitions that get a lot of action are NOT candidates for moves
     * unless the node itself is either overutilized, about to exhaust its DISK,
     * or other nodes are at very low utilization. We always prefer to move the
     * "warm" index partitions instead.
     * 
     * <h2> DISK exhaustion </h2>
     * 
     * Running out of DISK space causes an urgent condition and can lead to
     * failure or all services on the same host. Therefore, when a host is near
     * to exhausting its DISK space it (a) MUST notify the
     * {@link ILoadBalancerService}; (b) temporary files SHOULD be purged; it
     * MAY choose to shed indices that are "hot for write" since that will slow
     * down the rate at which the disk space is consumed; and (d) the resource
     * manager MAY aggressively release old resources, even at the expense of
     * forcing transactions to abort.
     * 
     * FIXME implement suggestions for handling cases when we are nearing DISK
     * exhaustion.
     * 
     * FIXME read locks for read-committed operations. For example, queries to
     * the mds should use a read-historical tx so that overflow in the mds will
     * not cause the views to be discarded during data service overflow. In
     * fact, we can just create a read-historical transaction when we start data
     * service overflow and then pass it into the rest of the process, aborting
     * that tx when overflow is complete.
     * 
     * FIXME consider move as post-compact action using socket to blast the data
     * to the target data service.
     * 
     * FIXME make the atomic update tasks truely atomic using distributed locks,
     * paxos state, and correcting actions.
