/**
 * Task moves an index partition to another {@link IDataService}.
 * <p>
 * This task runs as a historical read operation and copy the view of the index
 * partition as of the lastCommitTime of old journal to another
 * {@link IDataService}. Once that historical view has been copied, this task
 * then submits an {@link AtomicUpdateMoveIndexPartitionTask}. The atomic
 * update is an {@link ITx#UNISOLATED} operation. It is responsible copying any
 * writes buffered for the index partition on the live journal to the target
 * {@link IDataService} and then updating the {@link MetadataIndex}. Once the
 * atomic update task is finished, clients will discover that the source index
 * partition does not exist. When they query the {@link MetadataService} they
 * will discover that the key(-range) is now handled by the new index partition
 * on the target {@link IDataService}.
 * <p>
 * Note: This task is run on the target {@link IDataService} and it copies the
 * data from the source {@link IDataService}. This allows us to use standard
 * {@link IRangeQuery} operations to copy the historical view. However, the
 * {@link AtomicUpdateMoveIndexPartitionTask} is run on the source
 * {@link IDataService} since it needs to obtain an exclusive lock on the index
 * partition that is being moved in order to prevent concurrent writes during
 * the atomic cutover. For the same reason, the
 * {@link AtomicUpdateMoveIndexPartitionTask} can not use standard
 * {@link IRangeQuery} operations. Instead, it initiates a series of data
 * transfers while holding onto the exclusive lock until the target
 * {@link IDataService} has the current state of the index partition. At that
 * point it notifies the {@link IMetadataService} to perform the atomic cutover
 * to the new index partition.
 * <p>
 * Note: This task does NOT cause any resources associated with the current view
 * of the index partition to be released on the source {@link IDataService}.
 * The reason is two-fold. First, the {@link IndexSegment}(s) associated with
 * that view MAY be in used by historical views. Second, there MAY be historical
 * commit points for the index partition on the live journal before the atomic
 * cutover to the new {@link IDataService} - those historical commit points MUST
 * be preserved until the release policy for those views has been satisified.
 * <p>
 * Note: The MOVE task MUST be explicitly coordinated with the target
 * {@link IDataService}. Failure to coordinate the move results in an error
 * message reported by the {@link MetadataService} indicating that the wrong
 * partition locator was found under the key. The cause is a MOVE operation
 * during which the target data service undergoes concurrent synchronous (and
 * then asynchronous) overflow. What happens is the
 * {@link MoveIndexPartitionTask} registers the new index partition on the
 * target data service. One registered on the {@link IDataService}, the index
 * partition it is visible during synchronous overflow BEFORE the MOVE is
 * complete and BEFORE the index is registered with the {@link MetadataService}
 * and hence discoverable to clients. If the target {@link IDataService} then
 * undergoes synchronous and asynchronous overflow and chooses an action which
 * would change the index partition definition (split, join, or move) WHILE the
 * index partition is still being moved onto the target {@link IDataService}
 * THEN the MOVE is not atomic and the definition of the index partition in the
 * {@link MetadataService} will not coherently reflect either the MOVE or the
 * action choosen by the target {@link IDataService}, depending on which one
 * makes its atomic update first.
 * <p>
 * The target {@link IDataService} MAY undergo both synchronous and asynchronous
 * overflow as {@link IDataService}s are designed to allow continued writes
 * during those operations. Further, it MAY choose to copy, build, or compact
 * the index partition while it is being moved. However, it MUST NOT choose any
 * action (split, join, or move) that would change the index partition
 * definition until the move is complete (whether it ends in success or
 * failure).
 * <p>
 * This issue is addressed by the following protocol:
 * <ol>
 * 
 * <li>The {@link MoveIndexPartitionTask} set the
 * <code>sourcePartitionId</code> on the {@link LocalPartitionMetadata} when
 * it registers the index partition on the target {@link IDataService}. When
 * <code>sourcePartitionId != -1</code>. the target {@link IDataService} is
 * restricted to for that index partition to overflows actions which do not
 * change the index partition definition (copy, build, or merge). Further, any
 * index partition found on restart whose by the target {@link IDataService}
 * whose <code>sourcePartitionId != -1</code> is deleted as it was never
 * successfully put into play (this prevents partial moves from accumulating
 * state which could not otherwise be released.)</li>
 * 
 * <li>The atomic update task causes the <code>sourcePartitionId</code> to be
 * set to <code>-1</code> as one of its last actions, thereby allowing the
 * target {@link IDataService} to use operations that could re-define the index
 * parition (split, join, move) and also preventing the target index partition
 * from being deleted on restart. </li>
 * 
 * </ol>
 * 
 * @todo If the atomic update task fails, then: (a) if the target index
 *       partition has already been recorded in the {@link MetadataService} then
 *       that definition MUST be rolled back; and (b) the target index partition
 *       MUST be dropped from the target {@link IDataService} since its data
 *       will never be used and is not even visible to the
 *       {@link MetadataService}.
 * 
 * @todo In order to make MOVE atomic we need a more robust mechanism. This
 *       could be addressed w/ zookeeper. In particular, there must be a global
 *       lock in order to prevent clients from accessing the new index partition
 *       definition on the {@link MetadataService} before the atomic update task
 *       completes. Likewise, if the atomic update task fails and the
 *       {@link MetadataService} has already been updated, then we need to
 *       rollback the change to the {@link MetadataService} (replacing the new
 *       index partition locator with the old one). Note that the source index
 *       partition is not dropped until the atomic update task completes
 *       successfully.
 * 
 * @todo MOVE could also be a (full or partial) build followed by a copy of the
 *       index segment(s) in the view to the target data service and finally
 *       followed by the atomic update, which would copy over any tuples that
 *       have been buffered on the live journal. This could be much less
 *       expensive (depending on the state of the source index partition) and
 *       the data to be moved could be blasted across a socket. Try it out both
 *       ways.

     * partition identified by the {@link MoveResult} MUST already exist and
     * MUST have been populated with the state of the source index partition
     * view as of the lastCommitTime of the old journal. The task copies any
     * writes that have been buffered for the index partition on the source data
     * service to the target data service and then does an atomic update of the
     * {@link MetadataService} while it is holding an exclusive lock on the
     * source index partition.
     * <p>
     * Tasks executing after this one will discover that the source index
     * partition no longer exists as of the timestamp when this task commits.
     * Clients that submit tasks for the source index partition will be notified
     * that it no longer exists. When the client queries the
     * {@link MetadataService} it will discover that the key range has been
     * assigned to a new index partition - the one on the target data service.
     * <p>
     * Note: This task runs as {@link ITx#UNISOLATED} since it MUST have an
     * exclusive lock in order to ensure that the buffered writes are
     * transferred to the target index partition without allowing concurrent
     * writes on the source index partition. This means that the target index
     * partition WILL NOT be able to issue read-requests against the live view
     * of source index partition since this task already holds the necessary
     * lock. Therefore this task instead sends zero or more {@link ResultSet}s
     * containing the buffered writes to the target index partition.
     * <p>
     * Note: The {@link ResultSet} data structure is used since it carries
     * "delete markers" and version timestamps as well as the keys and values.
     * The delete markers MUST be transferred in case the buffered writes
     * include deletes of index entries as of the lastCommitTime on the old
     * journal. If the index supports transactions then the version timestamps
     * MUST be preserved since they are the basis for validation of transaction
     * write sets.
