/**
 * Abstract base class for tasks run during post-processing of a journal by the
 * {@link ResourceManager}. These tasks are designed with a historical read
 * that handles history up to some specified commitTime and the submits an
 * {@link ITx#UNISOLATED} task that brings things up to date and coordinates an
 * atomic update between the {@link IDataService}(s) and the
 * {@link IMetadataService}. You SHOULD be able to run any task at any time as
 * long as overflow is disabled while these tasks are running (this is a
 * pre-condition for all of these tasks).
 * 
 * FIXME There is a potential failure point once we notify the metadata service
 * of the change in the index partitions since this is done before the task has
 * actually committed its changes on the live journal. If the commit on the
 * journal fails then the metadata index will now reference index partitions
 * which do not exist (or do not have all their data) on the live journal. A
 * full transaction might be one way to close this gap. The opportunity for
 * failure could be significantly reduced by checkpointing all indices before we
 * RMI the MDS.
