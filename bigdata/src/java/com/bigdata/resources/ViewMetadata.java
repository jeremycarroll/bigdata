     * scale-out index until they are at least 100 index partitions. Thereafter
     * the as configured behavior will be observed.
     * <p>
     * Note: The potential parallelism of a data service is limited by the #of
     * index partitions on that data service as well as by the workload of the
     * application. By partitioning new and young indices aggressively we ensure
     * that the index is broken into multiple index partitions on the initial
     * data service. Those index partitions will be re-distributed across the
     * available data services based on recommendations made by the load
     * balancer. Both breaking an index into multiple partitions on a single
     * data service and re-distributing those index partitions among the hosts
     * of a cluster will increase the resources (CPU, DISK, RAM) which can be
     * brought to bear on the index. In particular, there is a constraint of a
     * single core per index partition (for writes). Therefore breaking a new
     * index into 2 pieces doubles the potential concurrency for a data service
     * on a host with at least 2 cores. This can be readily extrapolated to a
     * cluster with 8 cores x 16 machines, etc.
     * <p>
     * Note: The adjustment is proportional to the #of existing index partitions
     * and is adjusted using a floating point discount factor. This should
     * prevent a split triggering a subsequent join on the next overflow.
