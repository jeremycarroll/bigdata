/**
 * Class encapsulates logic and handshaking for tracking which indices (and
 * their backing stores) are recently and currently referenced. This information
 * is used to coordinate the close out of index resources (and their backing
 * stores) on an LRU basis by the {@link ResourceManager}.
 * 
 * @todo Scale-out index import and index recovery
 *       <p>
 *       Note that key range partitioned indices are simply registered under a
 *       name that reflects both the scale-out index name and the index
 *       partition#. The metadata index provides the integrating structure for
 *       those individual index partitions. A {@link ClientIndexView} uses the
 *       {@link MetadataIndex} to provide transparent access to the scale-out
 *       index.
 *       <p>
 *       It should be possible to explicitly convert an index that supports
 *       delete markers into a scale-out index. The right model might be to
 *       "import" the index into an existing federation since there needs to be
 *       an explicit {@link MetadataService} on hand. There will only be a
 *       single partition of the index initially, but that can be broken down
 *       either because it is too large or because it becomes too large. The
 *       import can be realized by moving all of the data off of the journal
 *       onto one or more {@link IndexSegment}s, moving those index segment
 *       files into a selected data service, and then doing an "index recovery"
 *       operation that hooks up the index segment(s) into an index and
 *       registers the metadata index for that index. (Note that we can't make
 *       an index into a key-range partitioned index unless there is a metadata
 *       index lying around somewhere.)
 *       <p>
 *       Work through a federated index recovery where we re-generate the
 *       metadata index from the on hand data services.
