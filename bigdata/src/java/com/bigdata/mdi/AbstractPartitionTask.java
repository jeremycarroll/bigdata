     * </pre>
     * 
     * To a first approximation, the splits are every m' index entries.
     * 
     * However, the split rule then needs to examine the actual keys at and
     * around those split points and adjust them as necessary.
     * 
     * The running over/under run in sum(m') is maintained and the suggested
     * split points are adjusted by that over/under run.
     * 
     * Repeat until all split points have been identifed and validated by the
     * split run.
     * 
     * @todo could do special case version when the index is an
     *       {@link AbstractBTree} and {@link AbstractBTree#keyAt(int)} can be
     *       used.
     * 
     * @todo make sure that view of the index partition does not expose keyAt() -
     *       this may break a lot of code assumptions - or at least throws an
     *       exception for it.
     * 
     * FIXME when the index partition is a fused view we do not have a keyAt()
     * implementation. (It's possible that this could be achieved using keyAt()
     * to do a binary search probing on each of the components of that view and
     * computing the rangeCount(null,k) for each key pulled out of the
     * underlying indices, but this seems pretty complex.)
     * 
     * Another approach is a prefix scan. This is nice because it will only
     * touch on the possible index separator keys, but it only works when the
     * split points are constrained. If we allow any key as an index separator
     * key then there is no prefix that we can use. Also, this might not work
     * with the sparse row store since the [schema,primaryKey] are not fixed
     * length fields.
     * 
     * An incremental approach is to consume M index entries halting at the key
     * that forms an acceptable index partition separator closest to M (either
     * before or after). This suggests that we can not pre-compute the split
     * points when the index is a fused view but rather that we have to
     * sequentially process the index deciding as we go where the split points
     * are.
     * 
     * The inputs are then: (a) the #of index entries per partition, m'; (b) the
     * desired size in bytes of each index partition; (c) the split rule which
     * will decide what is an acceptable index partition separator; and (d) an
     * iterator scanning the index partition view.

     *       size (#of bytes) splits.

     * manager will apply a policy determining when to delete behind old
     * resources, but only the most current value is ever copied into an index
     * segment. (c) An index with only delete markers supports scale-out and

     * isolated index, so only the most recent value is copied into an index
     * segment during a build. A zero history policy can be used for (c) in

     * immediately available for delete (in the case of an index segment; in the
     * case of a journal it is available for delete once no index partition has
     * data on that journal). The file system zones are an application of (c)
     * where the zone (set of index partitions with a common policy) causes
     * resources to be maintained for some amount of time (there is no way to
     * handle "some number of versions" outside of the sparse row store with the
     * timestamps in the keys, just age of the resources). If isolated and
     * unisolated indices will be mixed on a journal then the retention policy
     * for that journal needs to be the maximum (AND) of the recommendations of
     * the individual policies.

     * FIXME The choice of keys MUST be informed by metadata ideally attached to
     * the metadata index. Basically, we need an {@link ISplitRule} that "knows"
     * when a key would split an indivisable unit, such as a logical row in a
     * sparse row store. The rule could be more sophisticated and "prefer"
     * certain split points, but there are some split points that are hard
     * constraints. The same "rule" could potentially be used to count logical
     * "rows" for the {@link SparseRowStore} row iterator.
     * 
     * FIXME A merge rule that knows about version timestamps and deletion
     * markers. The output {@link IndexSegment} will contain timestamps and
     * deletion markers and support isolation.
     * 
     * FIXME write a "split" task that finds the split points for an index
     * partition and then runs N merge tasks, one per split point. this is very
     * straight forward. work through simple scenarios such as dynamically
     * splitting the indices for an RDF database and periodically performing
     * compacting merges of the index partitions (there are two reasons to do a
     * compacting merge - one is to move data onto the read-only index segments
     * with their optimized storage and higher branching factors; the other is
     * to purge deleted versions).
     * 
     * @todo test both the split and the merge tasks and get some sense of their
     *       performance, but note the limits on the development platform
     *       (laptop vs server).
     * 
     * @todo Once this is in hand, consider again what it takes to achieve an
     *       "atomic" split or "atomic" merge. For example, if we can take the
     *       "live" btree on the journal and atomically rename it (or otherwise
     *       set up its last commit point as a btree readable by another name)
     *       and describe the index partition as a view including the old "live"
     *       btree and a new "live" btree then we can continue to absorb writes
     *       on the new view while doing the split on the old view. Once the
     *       split completes we can split up any data accumulated on the new
     *       btree among the new index partitions and then atomically delete the
     *       new btree putting the new index partitions into service.
     * 
     * @todo since partition identifiers need to be assigned by the MDI this
     *       implies that all splits or joins must first be pre-declared at the
     *       MDI (but somehow not yet in use) so as to reserve the partition
     *       identifiers.
     * 
     * @todo It is an error to supply a <i>fromKey</i> that is not also the
     *       separatorKey for the partition, however the code does not detect
     *       this error.
     * 
     * @todo It is possible for the partition to be redefined (joined with a
     *       sibling or split into two partitions). In this case any already
     *       scheduled operations MUST abort and new operations with the correct
     *       separator keys must be scheduled.
     * 
     * @todo do I need a full timestamp for the index entries in order to
     *       support history policies based on age? If the timestamp is the time
     *       at which the commit group begins then the timestamps can be
     *       compressed readily using a dictionary since there will tend to be
     *       very few distinct timestamps per leaf.
