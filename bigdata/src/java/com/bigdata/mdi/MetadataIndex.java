/**
 * A metadata index for the partitions of a distributed index. There is one
 * metadata index for each distributed index. The keys of the metadata index are
 * the first key that would be directed into the corresponding index segment,
 * e.g., a <em>separator key</em> (this is just the standard btree semantics).
 * The values are serialized {@link PartitionLocator} objects.
 * <p>
 * Note: At this time the recommended scale-out approach for the metadata index
 * is to place the metadata indices on a {@link MetadataService} (the same
 * {@link MetadataService} may be used for an arbitrary #of scale-out indices)
 * and to <em>replicate</em> the state for the {@link MetadataService} onto
 * failover {@link MetadataService}s. Since the {@link MetadataIndex} may grow
 * without bound, you simply need to have enough disk on hand for it (the size
 * requirements are quite modest). Further, the {@link MetadataService} MUST NOT
 * be used to hold the data for the scale-out indices themselves since the
 * {@link MetadataIndex} can not undergo {@link IResourceManager#overflow()}.
 * <p>
 * One advantage of this approach is that the {@link MetadataIndex} is
 * guarenteed to hold all historical states of the partition definitions for
 * each index - effectively it is an immortal store for the partition metadata.
 * On the other hand it is not possible to compact the metadata index without
 * taking the database offline.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo The {@link MetadataIndex} does NOT support either overflow (it may NOT
 *       be a {@link FusedView}) NOR key-range splits. There are several issues
 *       involved:
 *       <p>
 *       (a) How to track the next partition identifier to be assigned to an
 *       index partition for the managed index. Currently this value is written
 *       in the {@link MetadataIndexCheckpoint} record and is propagated to the
 *       new backing store on overflow. However, if the metadata index is split
 *       into partitions then additional care MUST be taken to use only the
 *       value of that field on the 'meta-meta' index.
 *       <p>
 *       (b) how to locate the partitions of the metadata index itself.
 *       <p>
 *       (c) The {@link IMetadataIndex} defines some operations which depend on
 *       the {@link ILinearList} API. However, per {@link FusedView}, it is NOT
 *       possible to efficiently implementat that API for a fused view.
 * 
 * @todo Here are some options for scale-out on the metadata index.
 *       <p>
 *       In fact, while delete markers in the index partition views facilitate
 *       overflow processing they make it impossible to use the
 *       {@link ILinearList} API which we need for the metadata index. However,
 *       it is in fact possible to write the {@link ILinearList} API for a
 *       key-range partitioned index without delete markers in the index
 *       partitions (WRITE THIS CODE AND TEST IT BEFORE GOING FURTHER TO PROVE
 *       THE POINT). So, that is how to handle scale-out for the metadata index.
 *       <p>
 *       Getting this working will require somewhat different handling of
 *       scale-out indices when delete markers are not allowed. For one thing,
 *       overflow of an index without delete markers requires immediate copying
 *       of the index (partition) onto the new journal. if the index has too
 *       many entries then it must be split during that overflow processing. You
 *       can't use index segments since they imply deletion markers in the index
 *       views.
 *       <p>
 *       A split can be processed during overflow, and the new index partitions
 *       will wind up on the new journal. Likewise, an index partition can be
 *       sent to a different metadata service, but this will require a custom
 *       operation to send along everything from some historical commit point
 *       for the index partition and either deny writes on the index partition
 *       until we cut over to its new location (by far the easiest) or journal
 *       writes so that the index can be made current on the new location before
 *       we cut over (frought with potential problems).
 *       <p>
 *       A meta-metadata index might be necessary to locate the key-range
 *       partitions of a metadata index.
 *       <p>
 *       Overall it seems that the choice of delete markers provides more
 *       flexibility in overflow operations while working without delete markers
 *       allows the use of the {@link ILinearList} API. Probably both should be
 *       supported throughout so that the {@link MetadataIndex} is not a special
 *       case, but just an application that requires the {@link ILinearList} and
 *       hence does not use delete markers and pays some different costs for
 *       overflow and split operations and may have to handle replication
 *       differently.
 *       <p>
 *       Since there are no deletion markers, we can't use transactional
 *       isolation on the metadata index either. Probably we will have to make
 *       use of a mechanism to broadcast the read-behind time to clients for the
 *       metadata index and clients will have to update their cache when the
 *       index moves into its next consistent state.
 * 
 * @todo the metadata index can be hash partitioned and range queries can be
 *       flooded to all partitions so that we do not need a meta-metadata index
 *       to locate metadata index partitions. the #of metadata service nodes can
 *       be changed by a suitable broadcast event in which clients have to
 *       change to the new hash basis. this feature can be generalized to
 *       provide hash partitioned indices as well as key-range partitioned
 *       indices.
 * 
 * @todo A metadata index can be recovered by a distributed process running over
 *       the data services. Each data service reports all index partitions. The
 *       reports are collected and the index is rebuilt from the reports. Much
 *       like a map/reduce job.
