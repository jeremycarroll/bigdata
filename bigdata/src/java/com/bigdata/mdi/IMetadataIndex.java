/**
 * Interface for a metadata index.
 * 
 * @todo define implementations of this interface that handle smart caching and
 *       update of index partition metadata for the client side. It may be that
 *       those implementations should be a wrapper around an {@link IIndex} that
 *       encapsulates the logic for partition operations, but I also need to
 *       handle caching in a smart way.
 *       <p>
 *       The {@link IMetadataService} currently exposes some of the methods from
 *       the metadata index - perhaps those should be taken out of that API and
 *       moved onto {@link IMetadataIndex}, especially since we tend to cache
 *       things.
 * 
 * @todo If these methods are to be invoked remotely then we will need to
 *       returning the byte[] rather than the de-serialized
 *       {@link PartitionLocator}.
