/**
 * <p>
 * An implementation of an extensible hash map using a 32 bit hash code and a
 * fixed length int[] for the bucket. The keys are int32 values. The data stored
 * in the hash map is just the key. Buckets provide a perfect fit for N keys.
 * This is used to explore the dynamics of the extensible hashing algorithm
 * using some well known examples.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Extensible Hashing</h2>
 * <p>
 * Extensible (or extendable) hashing uses a directory and pages (or buckets) to
 * store the data. Directories make it possible to share pages, which can
 * improve the storage efficiency, but directory schemes can suffer from
 * exponential growth when the hash values are not uniformly distributed (a
 * variety of schemes may be used to compensate for that growth, including
 * overflow pages, multi-level directories, better hash functions, etc).
 * Extensible hashing uses a global depth, <i>d</i>, which corresponds to the
 * <i>d</i>-bits of the hash value used to select the directory entry. Each
 * bucket has a local depth which is used to track the #of directory entries
 * which target the same bucket. When an insert would fail due to insufficient
 * space in the target bucket, the bucket must either be split, increased in
 * size, or linked with an overflow page. If the directory has only a single
 * reference to a given page, then the directory must be doubled when the page
 * is split. Overflow pages can be used to defer doubling the size of the
 * directory (and are required when all hash bits are the same, such as when the
 * keys are identical), but overflow pages can degrade point test performance
 * since a miss on the primary bucket will cause a read through to the page(s)
 * of the overflow chain. Increasing the size of the bucket can also be used to
 * defer the doubling of the address space (or handle duplicate keys) and can
 * translate into better IO efficiency. Extensible hash trees use recursive
 * directory structures. Recursive directories essentially allow a hash table to
 * be imposed on the overflow pages which would otherwise be associated with the
 * primary page and thereby increase the efficiency of access to hash values
 * with skewed distributions. Order preserving hash functions may be used to
 * create hash indices which cluster keys (which can improve efficiency at all
 * levels of the memory hierarchy) and support range scans. Order preserving
 * multi-dimensional extensible hashing is a generalization of extensible
 * hashing suitable for spatial data and clustered aggregations. The design of
 * the directory (and handling of split/overflow decision) for both single and
 * multi-dimensional extensible hashing can have an enormous impact on the size
 * of the directory and the storage and retrieval efficiency of the index.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Implementation Design</h2>
 * <p>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation is not thread-safe. I have not attempted to provide for
 * visibility guarantees when resizing the map and I have not attempted to
 * provide for concurrent updates. The implementation exists solely to explore
 * the extensible hashing algorithm.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @todo Name htable implies single level directory where htree implies a
 *       multi-level directory. Figure out the directory scheme and lock in the
 *       name for the class.
 * 
 * @todo Backfill in the notes on the implementation design as it gets locked
 *       in.
 * 
 * @todo We can not directly implement {@link Map} unless the hash table is
 *       configured to NOT permit duplicates.
 * 
 * @todo Integrate a ring buffer for retention of frequently accessed pages per
 *       the weak reference policy observed by the BTree with touch()
 *       
 *       @deprecated This has been replaced by the {@link HTree}.
