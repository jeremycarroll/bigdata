     * <p>
     * A leaf is split by choosing the first key to copy to the new right
     * sibling. The leaf is split into (leaf, rightSibling) and we
     * insert(splitKey, rightSibling) into the parent. Since keys and values
     * are paired one-to-one in a leaf, all keys and values starting with
     * the split index are copied into the new right sibling.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The most cited policy for splitting a leaf is to choose the key at
     * m/2, where m is the maximum #of values for a leaf (aka the branching
     * factor or the order of the leaves in the tree).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, when m := 3.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <pre>
     * keys : [ k0 k1 k2 ]
     * vals : [ v0 v1 v2 ]
     * </pre>
     * 
     * <p>
     * If we choose m/2 equals one(1) as the split index, then the key k1 is
     * inserted into the parent and the leaf is split as follows:
     * </p>
     * 
     * <pre>
     * keys : [ k0 | k1 k2 ] =&gt; [ k0      ] [ k1 k2    ]
     * vals : [ v0 | v1 v2 ] =&gt; [ v0      ] [ v1 v2    ]
     * </pre>
     * 
     * <p>
     * The split index MUST partition the leaf into two non-empty leaves.
     * This means that the split index MUST be choosen from the range
     * [1:#keys-1].
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, if we choose #keys-1 equals 3-1 equals two (2), then the
     * leaf is split as follows and we will insert the key k2 into the
     * parent.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <pre>
     * keys : [ k0 k1 | k2 ] =&gt; [ k0 k1   ] [ k2       ]
     * vals : [ v0 v1 | v2 ] =&gt; [ v0 v1   ] [ v2       ]
     * </pre>
     * 
     * @param leaf
     *            The leaf to be split.
     * @return The index of the first key to copy to the new right sibling.
