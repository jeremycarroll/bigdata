/**
 * This class coordinates a schedule among concurrent operations requiring
 * exclusive access to shared resources. Whenever possible, the result is a
 * concurrent schedule - that is, operations having non-overlapping lock
 * requirements run concurrently while operations that have lock contentions are
 * queued behind operations that currently have locks on the relevant resources.
 * A {@link ResourceQueue} is created for each resource and used to block
 * operations that are awaiting a lock. When locks are not being pre-declared, a
 * {@link TxDag WAITS_FOR} graph is additionally used to detect deadlocks.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @param R
 *            The type of the object that identifies a resource for the purposes
 *            of the locking system. This is typically the name of an index.
 * 
 * FIXME The {@link ConcurrencyManager} will need to explicitly use this class
 * to buffer unisolated operations such that they are only submitted to the
 * {@link WriteExecutorService} once they already have their locks.
 * <p>
 * {@link AbstractTask} needs to be refactored as well since I believe it
 * currently takes responsibility for acquiring the locks and it should not.
 * 
 * FIXME In order to support 2PL we need to decouple the {@link LockFutureTask}
 * from the transaction with which it is associated. Otherwise each
 * {@link #submit(Comparable[], Callable)} will look like a new transaction (2PL
 * is impossible unless you can execute multiple tasks for the same
 * transaction).
 * <p>
 * Perhaps this would be easier if we did not delegate the task to an
 * {@link Executor} since that does not really support the 2PL pattern.
 * 
 * @todo Support escalation of operation priority based on time and scheduling
 *       of higher priority operations. the latter is done by queueing lock
 *       requests in front of pending requests for each resource on which an
 *       operation attempt to gain a lock. The former is just a dynamic
 *       adjustment of the position of the operation in the resource queue where
 *       it is awaiting a lock (an operation never awaits more than one lock at
 *       a time). This facility could be used to give priority to distributed
 *       transactions over local unisolated operations and to priviledge certain
 *       operations that have low latency requirements. This is not quite a
 *       "real-time" guarentee since the VM is not (normally) providing
 *       real-time guarentees and since we are not otherwise attempting to
 *       ensure anything except lower latency when compared to other operations
 *       awaiting their own locks.
