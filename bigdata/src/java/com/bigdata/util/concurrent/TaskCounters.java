/**

 * @todo add counters for commit waiting time, task checkpoint time (as part of
 *       task service time), and commit service time and report out those data
 *       as moving averages.
 * 
 * @todo for the client add counters for retry's as follow ups to a
 *       {@link StaleLocatorException}.
