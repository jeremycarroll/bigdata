/**
 * A fly weight helper class that runs tasks either sequentially or with limited
 * parallelism against some thread pool. Deadlock can arise when limited
 * parallelism is applied if there are dependencies among the tasks. Limited
 * parallelism is enforced using a counting {@link Semaphore}. New tasks can
 * start iff the latch is non-zero. The maximum parallelism is the minimum of
 * the value specified to the constructor and the potential parallelism of the
 * delegate service.
 * <p>
 * Note: The pattern for running tasks on this service is generally to
 * {@link #execute(Runnable)} a {@link Runnable} and to make that
 * {@link Runnable} a {@link FutureTask} if you want to await the {@link Future}
 * of a {@link Runnable} or {@link Callable} or otherwise manage its execution.
 * <p>
 * Note: This class can NOT be trivially wrapped as an {@link ExecutorService}
 * since the resulting delegation pattern for submit() winds up invoking
 * execute() on the delegate {@link ExecutorService} rather than on this class.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo write unit tests.
