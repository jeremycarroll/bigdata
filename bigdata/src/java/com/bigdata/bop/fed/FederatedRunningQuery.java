 *       the nodes on which the query has been executed and a per-query
 *       bop:ResourceList map identifying the resources associated with the
 *       execution of that bop on that node. In fact, this could be the same
 *       {@link #resourceMap} except that we would lose type information about
 *       the nature of the resource so it is better to have distinct maps for
 *       this purpose.

     * A map associating resources with running queries. When a query halts, the

     * {@link ByteBuffer}s backing either incoming or outgoing
     * {@link BindingSetChunk}s, temporary files associated with the query, hash

     * @todo This map will eventually need to be moved into {@link RunningQuery}
     *       in order to support temporary graphs or other disk-backed resources
     *       associated with the evaluation of a query against a standalone
     *       database. However, the main use case are the resources associated
     *       with query against an {@link IBigdataFederation} which it why it is
     *       being developed in the {@link FederatedRunningQuery} class.
     * 
     * @todo Cache any resources materialized for the query on this node (e.g.,
     *       temporary graphs materialized from a peer or the client). A bop
     *       should be able to demand those data from the cache and otherwise
     *       have them be materialized.
     * 
     * @todo Only use the values in the map for transient objects, such as a
     *       hash table which is not backed by the disk. For {@link ByteBuffer}s
     *       we want to make the references go through the {@link ResourceService}
     *       . For files, through the {@link ResourceManager}.
     * 
     * @todo We need to track the resources in use by the query so they can be
     *       released when the query terminates. This includes: buffers; joins
     *       for which there is a chunk of binding sets that are currently being
     *       executed; downstream joins (they depend on the source joins to
     *       notify them when they are complete in order to decide their own
     *       termination condition); local hash tables which are part of a DHT
     *       (especially when they are persistent); buffers and disk resources
     *       allocated to N-way merge sorts, etc.
     *

     * A map of all allocation contexts associated with this query.
     * 
     * FIXME Separate out the life cycle of the allocation from the allocation
     * context. This is necessary so we can send chunks to multiple receivers or
     * retry transmission if a receiver dies.
     * 
     * FIXME When a chunk is transferred to the receiver, its allocation(s) must
     * be released on the sender. That should be done based on the life cycle of
     * the allocation. This implies that we should maintain a list for each life
     * cycle so they can be cleared without scanning the set of all allocations.
     * 
     * FIXME When the query is done, those allocations MUST be released
     * (excepting only allocations associated with the solutions which need to
     * be released as those data are consumed).
     * 
     * <pre>
     * Query terminates: releaseAllocationContexts(queryId)
     * BOp terminates: releaseAllocationContexts(queryId,bopId)
     * BOp+shard terminates: releaseAllocationContexts(queryId,bopId,shardId)
     * receiver takes data: releaseAllocations(IChunkMessage)
     * </pre>
     * 
     * The allocation contexts which use a bopId MUST use the bopId of the
     * operator which will consume the chunk. That way the producer can release
     * outputs buffered for that consumer as they are transferred to the
     * consumer. [If we leave the allocations in place until the bop evaluates
     * the chunk then we could retry if the node running the bop fails.]
     * <p>
     * Allocations which are tied to the life cycle of a {@link BOp}, rather the
     * the chunks processed for that {@link BOp}, should use (queryId,bopId).
     * For example, a DHT imposing distinct on a default graph access path has a
     * life cycle linked to the join reading on that access path (not the
     * predicate since the predicate is not part of the pipeline and is
     * evaluated by the join rather than the query engine).
     * <p>
     * Allocations tied to the life cycle of a query will not be released until
     * the query terminates. For example, a temporary graph containing the
     * ontology for a parallel distributed closure operation.

    /**
     * Create and send an {@link IChunkMessage} from some intermediate results.
     * Various optimizations are employed depending on the amount of data to be
     * moved and whether or not the target is this service.
     * 
     * @param serviceUUID
     *            The {@link UUID} of the {@link IQueryPeer} who is the
     *            recipient.
     * @param sinkId
     *            The identifier of the target {@link BOp}.
     * @param allocationContext
     *            The allocation context within which the {@link ByteBuffer}s
     *            will be managed for this {@link NIOChunkMessage}.
     * @param source
     *            The binding sets to be formatted onto a buffer.
     * 
     * @return The {@link NIOChunkMessage}.
     * 
     * @todo This is basically a factory for creating {@link IChunkMessage}s.
     *       That factory pattern in combined with the logic to send the message
     *       so we can do within JVM handoffs. We could break these things apart
     *       using {@link IChunkMessage#isMaterialized()} to detect inline
     *       cases. That would let us send out the messages in parallel, which
     *       could help to cut latency when an operator has a large fan out (in
     *       scale-out when mapping over shards or nodes).
     * 
     * @todo Release the allocations associated with each output chunk once it
     *       is received by the remote service.
     *       <p>
     *       When the query terminates all output chunks targeting any node
     *       EXCEPT the query controller should be immediately dropped.
     *       <p>
     *       If there is an error during query evaluation, then the output
     *       chunks for the query controller should be immediately dropped.
     *       <p>
     *       If the iterator draining the results on the query controller is
     *       closed, then the output chunks for the query controller should be
     *       immediately dropped.
     * 
     * @todo There are a few things for which the resource must be made
     *       available to more than one operator evaluation phase. The best
     *       examples are temporary graphs for parallel closure and large
     *       collections of graphIds for SPARQL "NAMED FROM DATA SET"
     *       extensions.
     * 
     * @todo Rethink the multiplicity relationship between chunks output from an
     *       operator, chunks output from mapping the operator over shards or
     *       nodes, RMI messages concerning buffers available for the sink
     *       operator on the various nodes, and the #of allocations per RMI
     *       message on both the sender and the receiver.
     *       <p>
     *       I am pretty sure that none of these are strongly coupled, e.g.,
     *       they are not 1:1. Some stages can combine chunks. Multiple
     *       allocations could be required on either the sender or the receiver
     *       purely due to where the slices fall on the backing direct
     *       {@link ByteBuffer}s in the {@link DirectBufferPool} and the sender
     *       and receiver do not need to use the same allocation context or have
     *       the same projection of slices onto the backing buffers.
     *       <p>
     *       The one thing which is critical is that the query controller is
     *       properly informed of the #of chunks made available to an operator
     *       and consumed by that operator, that those reports must be in the
     *       same units, and that the reports must be delivered back to the
     *       query controller in a manner which does not transiently violate the
     *       termination conditions of the query.
