/**
 * Unsynchronized (non-thread safe) buffer maps the {@link IBindingSet}s across
 * the index partition(s) associated with an {@link IPredicate} and
 * {@link IKeyOrder}. For each source chunk, "as bound" versions of the target
 * {@link IPredicate} are constructed and the {@link IBindingSet}s in the chunk
 * are reordered based on {@link IKeyOrder#getFromKey(IKeyBuilder, IPredicate)}
 * for each asBound predicate. The {@link PartitionLocator}s are discovered for
 * each fromKey using an ordered locator scan and the binding sets are output
 * onto a shard or node specific {@link IBuffer} created by a concrete subclass.
 * The subclass is responsible for getting the binding sets from this node onto
 * the node associated with each output buffer.

 * @version $Id: UnsyncDistributedOutputBuffer.java 3448 2010-08-18 20:55:58Z
 *          thompsonbry $
 * @param <E>
 *            The generic type of the elements in the buffer.
 * @param <F>
 *            The generic type of the elements in the relation associated with
 *            the {@link IPredicate}.
 * 
 * @todo This could be refactored such that it no longer implemented
 *       {@link IBuffer} but instead was a {@link BOp} with binding sets
 *       streaming in from its source. However, unlike a normal {@link BOp} it
 *       would have a compound sink and it would have to be tightly integrated
 *       with the {@link QueryEngine} to be used.
 * 
 * @todo Figure out how we will combine binding set streams emerging from
 *       concurrent tasks executing on a given node destined for the same
 *       shard/node. (There is code in the {@link DistributedJoinTask} which
 *       does this for the same shard, but it does it on the receiver side.) Pay
 *       attention to the #of threads running in the join, the potential
 *       concurrency of threads targeting the same (bopId,shardId) and how to
 *       best combine their data together.
 * 
 * @todo Optimize locator lookup by caching in {@link AbstractSplitter} and look
 *       at the code path for obtaining {@link PartitionLocator}s from the MDI.
 *       <p>
 *       For reads, we are permitted to cache the locators just as much as we
 *       like (but indirection would be introduced by a shared disk
 *       architecture).
 *       <p>
 *       For writes (or in a shard disk architecture) it is possible that the
 *       target shard will have moved by the time the receiver has notice of the
 *       intent to write on that shard or once the receiver has accepted the
 *       binding sets for that shard. The logic which moves the binding sets
 *       around will have to handle such 'stale locator' exceptions
 *       automatically.
 * 
 * @todo This is not tracking the #of output chunks or the fanOut (#of
 *       shards/nodes which will receive binding sets). Given that the query
 *       engine will be managing the buffers on which the data are written, it
 *       might also update the appropriate statistics.
