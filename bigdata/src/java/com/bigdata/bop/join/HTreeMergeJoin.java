/**
 * An N-way merge join based on the {@link HTree}.
 * <p> 
 * For the {@link HTree}, the entries are in key order. Those keys are hash
 * codes computed from the solutions using the join variables. While this does
 * not change the fact that the {@link HTree} puts an order over the solutions,
 * there is a wrinkle as the hash code represents a collision bucket - a set of
 * solutions which have the same hash code. Thus we need to order the solutions
 * in each collision bucket. To do this, the iterator must advance until the key
 * changes, which signifies a new hash code and hence a new collision bucket.
 * The solutions in the last collision bucket must be placed into a total order
 * and delivered to the merge join algorithm in that total order.
 * 
 * TODO We could do the same thing with JVM hash indices. The
 * {@link JVMHashJoinUtility} explicitly models those collision buckets.
 * 
 * TODO Need to specify a {@link NamedSolutionSetRef}[] for this operator. This
 * makes it very {@link HTree} specific.
