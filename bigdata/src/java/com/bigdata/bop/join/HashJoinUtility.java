/**
 * Utility methods to support hash joins using an {@link HTree}. There are two
 * core steps, plus one additional step if the join is optional. The hash join
 * logically has a <em>Left Hand Side</em> (LHS) and a Right Hand Side (RHS).
 * The RHS is used to build up a hash index which is then probed for each LHS
 * solution. The LHS is generally an access path scan, which is done once. A
 * hash join therefore provides an alternative to a nested index join in which
 * we visit the access path once, probing the hash index for solutions which
 * join.
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Accept solutions</dt>
 * <dd>This step builds the hash index, also known as the RHS (Right Hand Side).
 * </dd>
 * <dt>hash join</dt>
 * <dd>The hash join considers each left solution in turn and outputs solutions
 * which join. If optionals are required, this step also builds an hash index
 * (the <i>joinSet</i>) over the right solutions which did join.</dd>
 * <dt>Output optionals</dt>
 * <dd>The RHS hash index is scanned and the <i>joinSet</i> is probed to
 * identify right solutions which did not join with any left solution. Those
 * solutions are output as "optionals".</dd>
 * </dl>
