 * @todo Add time per bop. This can not be directly aggregated into wall time
 *       since there are concurrent processes. However, this will be useful
 *       since we tend to process materialized chunks with the new
 *       {@link QueryEngine} such that the operator evaluation time now more or
 *       less directly corresponds to the time it takes to act on local data,
 *       producing local outputs. The {@link QueryEngine} itself now handles the
 *       transportation of data between the nodes so that time can be factored
 *       out of the local aspects of query execution.
