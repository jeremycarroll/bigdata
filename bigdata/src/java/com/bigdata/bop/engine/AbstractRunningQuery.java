/**
 * Abstract base class for various {@link IRunningQuery} implementations. The
 * purpose of this class is to isolate aspects common to different designs for
 * managing resources for a running query and make it easier to realize
 * different strategies for managing the resources allocated to a running query.
 * <p>
 * There are common requirements for the {@link IRunningQuery}, but a variety of
 * ways in which those requirements can be met. Among the common requirements
 * are a means to manage tradeoffs in the allocation of various resources to the
 * operators in each query. Some of the more important tradeoffs are the #of
 * threads to allocate to each operator (threads bounds IO for Java 6 since we
 * are using a synchronous IO model) and the amount of RAM allocated to each
 * operator (including RAM on the JVM heap and RAM on the native Java process
 * heap). If the #of threads is too restrictive, then queries will progress
 * slowly due to insufficient IO level parallelism. If the query buffers too
 * much data on the JVM heap, then it can cause GC overhead problems that can
 * drastically reduce the responsiveness and throughput of the JVM. Data can be
 * moved off of the JVM heap onto the Java process heap by serializing it into
 * <em>direct</em> {@link ByteBuffer}s. This can be very efficient in
 * combination with hash joins at the expense of increasing the latency to the
 * first result when compared with pipelined evaluation.

    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     * <p>
     * FIXME See PipelineOp.Annotations#MAX_MEMORY.
     * <p>
     * It would be nice to have the concept of a limit on the amount of native
     * memory which an operator may use. However, there is currently no way to
     * specify this for a child allocation context on the memory manager. Also,
     * even if we do this for the root MemoryManager, that leads to a situation
     * in which allocations will deadlock.
     * <p>
     * I think that we really want one of two things. Either we want to control
     * the amount of native memory which will be used before we begin evictions
     * to disk or we want to have the child allocation context simply toss an
     * error if it attempts to use too much native memory.
     * <p>
     * To place a limit on memory before eviction to disk (as opposed to
     * eviction to the memory manager) we need to create a new IRawStore
     * interface which maintains a map from an addr to the appropriate backing
     * persistence store BUT we have to somehow mark the addresses as being on
     * the MemoryManager or on an RWStore backed by DISK. This gets into the
     * question of whether or not there is a bit which is clean and available
     * for this purpose. (Consider that we also want such a bit for the HTree to
     * mark bucket pages versus directory pages in the address).
     * <p>
     * If we throw out an exception from the child memory manager if the memory
     * allocation limit is exceeded then we can bound the memory easily enough,
     * but it could lead to an unpleasant surprise.
     * <p>
     * If we do NOT bound the memory, then this could lead to swapping or a
     * kernel over commit error if the total memory burden of the native process
     * grows too large. It could also eat into the OS memory available to buffer
     * the disk.
     * <p>
     * For the moment I am NOT going to put a bound on the native memory which
     * can be allocated by an operator or a query and rely on the maximum
     * concurrency of the queries to have reasonable bounds on the memory
     * demand, but we should think about our options here.
     * <p>
     * I guess we could try the exception and re-do the operator against disk if
     * we have too.
     * <p>
     * Or if memory demand is high the query controller might throttle the start
     * of new queries, only allowing those which are apparently selective (based
     * on some inspection) to execute until more memory has been release...
     * <p>
     * But also see ChunkedRunningQuery#scheduleNext() which places bounds on
     * how much data can be buffered for an operator before it is evaluated.
     * That is the other way to interpret MAX_MEMORY, as a limit on the buffered
     * IBindingSet[]s which are input to the operator (assuming that they are
     * buffered on the native heap) rather than as a limit to the among of
     * native memory the operator may use while it is running.
