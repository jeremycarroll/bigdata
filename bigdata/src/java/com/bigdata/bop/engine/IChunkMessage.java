     * @todo we do not need to use {@link IAsynchronousIterator} any more. This
     *       could be much more flexible and should be harmonized to support
     *       high volume operators, GPU operators, etc. probably the right thing
     *       to do is introduce another interface here with a getChunk():IChunk
     *       where IChunk let's you access the chunks data in different ways
     *       (and chunks can be both {@link IBindingSet}[]s and element[]s so we
     *       might need to raise that into the interfaces and/or generics as
     *       well).
     * 
     * @todo It is likely that we can convert to the use of
     *       {@link BlockingQueue} instead of {@link BlockingBuffer} in the
     *       operators and then handle the logic for combining chunks inside of
     *       the {@link QueryEngine}. E.g., by scanning this list for chunks for
     *       the same bopId and combining them logically into a single chunk.
     *       <p>
     *       For scale-out, chunk combination will naturally occur when the node
     *       on which the operator will run requests the {@link ByteBuffer}s
     *       from the source nodes. Those will get wrapped up logically into a
     *       source for processing. For selective operators, those chunks can be
     *       combined before we execute the operator. For unselective operators,
     *       we are going to run over all the data anyway.
