/**
 * In order to setup the push/pop of the sink and altSink we need to specify
 * certain metadata about the source groupId, the target groupId, and whether
 * the transition is via the sink or the altSink. The groupId for the source and
 * target operators MAY be null, in which case the operator is understood to be
 * outside of any conditional binding group.
 * <p>
 * The action to be taken when the binding set is written to the sink or the
 * altSink is determined by a simple decision matrix.
 * 
 * <pre>
 *           | toGroup 
 * fromGroup + null + newGroup + sameGroup
 *     null  | NOP  | Push     | n/a
 *    group  | Pop  | Pop+Push | NOP
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The value of the [boolean:save] flag for pop is decided based on whether the
 * transition is via the default sink (save:=true) or the altSink (save:=false).
 * 
 * @see PipelineOp.Annotations#CONDITIONAL_GROUP
 * 
 * @todo Unit tests of this class in isolation.
 * 
 * @deprecated It appears that this design can not be made to satisfy SPARQL
 *             optional group semantics. Therefore, we may be able to drop this
 *             class, support for it in the {@link ChunkedRunningQuery} and
 *             support for the symbol table stack in {@link IBindingSet}.
