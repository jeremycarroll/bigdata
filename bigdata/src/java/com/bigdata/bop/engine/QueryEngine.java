/**
 * A class managing execution of concurrent queries against a local
 * {@link IIndexManager}.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Design notes</h2>
 * <p>
 * Much of the complexity of the current approach owes itself to having to run a
 * separate task for each join for each shard in order to have the appropriate
 * lock when running against the unisolated shard view. This also means that the
 * join task is running inside of the concurrency manager and hence has the
 * local view of the shard.
 * <p>
 * The main, and perhaps the only, reason why we run unisolated rules is during
 * closure, when we query against the unisolated indices and then write the
 * entailments back on the unisolated indices.
 * <p>
 * Supporting closure has always been complicated. This complexity is mostly
 * handled by ProgramTask#executeMutation() and
 * AbstractTripleStore#newJoinNexusFactory() which play games with the
 * timestamps used to read and write on the database, with commit points
 * designed to create visibility for tuples written by a mutation rule, and with
 * the automated advance of the read timestamp for the query in each closure
 * pass in order to make newly committed tuples visible to subsequent rounds of
 * closure. For scale-out, we do shard-wise auto commits so we always have a
 * commit point which makes each write visible and the read timestamp is
 * actually a read-only transaction which prevents the historical data we need
 * during a closure round from being released as we are driving updates onto the
 * federation. For the RWStore, we are having a similar problem (in the HA
 * branch since that is where we are working on the RWStore) where historically
 * allocated records were being released as writes drove updates on the indices.
 * Again, we "solved" the problem for the RWStore using a commit point followed
 * by a read-only transaction reading on that commit point to hold onto the view
 * on which the next closure round needs to read (this uncovered a problem with
 * the RWStore and transaction service interaction which Martyn is currently
 * working to resolve through a combination of shadow allocators and deferred
 * deletes which are processed once the release time is advanced by the
 * transaction service).
 * <p>
 * The WORM does not have some of these problems with closure because we never
 * delete history, so we do not need to create a commit point and a read-behind
 * transaction. However, the WORM would have problems with concurrent access to
 * the unisolated indices except that we hack that problem through the
 * transparent use of the UnisolatedReadWriteIndex, which allows multiple
 * threads to access the same unisolated index view using a read/write lock
 * pattern (concurrent readers are allowed, but there is only one writer and it
 * has exclusive access when it is running). This works out because we never run
 * closure operations against the WORM through the concurrency manager. If we
 * did, we would have to create a commit point after each mutation and use a
 * read-behind transaction to prevent concurrent access to the unisolated index.
 * <p>
 * The main advantage that I can see of the current complexity is that it allows
 * us to do load+closure as a single operation on the WORM, resulting in a
 * single commit point. This makes that operation ACID without having to use
 * full read/write transactions. This is how we gain the ACID contract for the
 * standalone Journal in the SAIL for the WORM. Of course, the SAIL does not
 * have that contract for the RWStore because we have to do the commit and
 * read-behind transaction in order to have visibility and avoid concurrent
 * access to the unisolated index (by reading behind on the last commit point).
 * <p>
 * I think that the reality is even one step more complicated. When doing truth
 * maintenance (incremental closure), we bring the temporary graph to a fixed
 * point (the rules write on the temp store) and then apply the delta in a
 * single write to the database. That suggests that incremental truth
 * maintenance would continue to be ACID, but that database-at-once-closure
 * would be round-wise ACID.
 * <p>
 * So, I would like to suggest that we break ACID for database-at-once-closure
 * and always follow the pattern of (1) do a commit before each round of
 * closure; and (2) create a read-behind transaction to prevent the release of
 * that commit point as we drive writes onto the indices. If we follow this
 * pattern then we can write on the unisolated indices without conflict and read
 * on the historical views without conflict. Since there will be a commit point
 * before each mutation rule runs (which corresponds to a closure round),
 * database-at-once-closure will be atomic within a round, but will not be a
 * single atomic operation. Per above, I think that we would retain the ACID
 * property for incremental truth maintenance against a WORM or RW mode Journal.
 * 
 * <p>
 * ----
 * </p>
 * 
 * The advantage of this proposal (commit before each mutation rule and run
 * query against a read-behind transaction) is that this could enormously
 * simplify how we execute joins.
 * <p>
 * Right now, we use a factory pattern to create a join task on each node for
 * each shard for which that node receives binding sets for a query. The main
 * reason for doing this is to gain the appropriate lock for the unisolated
 * index. If we never run a query against the unisolated index then we can go
 * around the concurrency manager and run a single "query manager" task for all
 * joins for all shards for all queries. This has some great benefits which I
 * will go into below.
 * <p>
 * That "query manager" task would be responsible for accepting buffers
 * containing elements or binding sets from other nodes and scheduling
 * consumption of those data based on various criteria (order of arrival,
 * priority, buffer resource requirements, timeout, etc.). This manager task
 * could use a fork join pool to execute light weight operations (NIO,
 * formulation of access paths from binding sets, mapping of binding sets onto
 * shards, joining a chunk already read from an access path against a binding
 * set, etc). Operations which touch the disk need to run in their own thread
 * (until we get Java 7 async file IO, which is already available in a preview
 * library). We could handle that by queuing those operations against a fixed
 * size thread pool for reads.
 * <p>
 * This is a radical change in how we handle distributed query execution, but I
 * think that it could have a huge payoff by reducing the complexity of the join
 * logic, making it significantly easier to execute different kinds of join
 * operations, reducing the overhead for acquiring locks for the unisolated
 * index views, reducing the #of threads consumed by joins (from one per shard
 * per join per query to a fixed pool of N threads for reads), etc. It would
 * centralize the management of resources on each node and make it possible for
 * us to handle things like join termination by simply purging data from the
 * query manager task for the terminated join.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo Expander patterns will continue to exist until we handle the standalone
 *       backchainers in a different manner for scale-out so add support for
 *       those for now.
 * 
 * @todo There is a going to be a relationship to recycling of intermediates
 *       (for individual {@link BOp}s or {@link BOp} tree fragments) and a
 *       distributed query cache which handles invalidation (for updates) and
 *       {@link BOp} aware reuse of result sets available in the cache. This
 *       sort of thing will have to be coordinated among the cache nodes.
