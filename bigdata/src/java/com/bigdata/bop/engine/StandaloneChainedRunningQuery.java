/**
 * An {@link IRunningQuery} implementation for a standalone database in which a
 * {@link BlockingQueue} is arranged in front of each operator task and each
 * operator task runs exactly once. While individual operators can buffer their
 * inputs if they need to run "operator-at-once", the dominant paradigm for this
 * class is pipelined evaluation. The pipeline will contain chunks of binding
 * sets, but each operator task will run exactly once and will run until its
 * input(s) have been closed. Since binding sets can be routed through the
 * default and the alternative sink, it is possible for there to be more than
 * one source which targets a given operator as its sink. These sources are
 * identified in advance and a counter is established which reflects the #of
 * sources writing on a given sink. The sink will consider its sources closed
 * only when that counter has been decremented to zero, indicating that all
 * sources for the sink have been closed.
 * <p>
 * This implementation does not use {@link IChunkMessage}s, can not be used with
 * scale-out, and does not support sharded indices.
 * 
 * @todo Since each operator task runs exactly once there is less potential
 *       parallelism in the operator task execution when compared to
 *       {@link ChunkedRunningQuery}. Determine whether or not queries evaluated
 *       by this class benefit from increased access path parallelism in
 *       pipelined join operators as a means of compensating for the decreased
 *       operator task parallelism or if the queue-based evaluation provides
 *       better overall throughput regardless.
 * 
 * @todo Run all unit tests of the query engine against the appropriate
 *       strategies.
