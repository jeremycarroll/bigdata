/**
 * UNION(ops)[maxParallel(default all)]
 * <p>
 * Executes each of the operands in the union as a subqueries. Each subquery is
 * run as a separate query but is linked to the parent query in which the UNION
 * is being evaluated. The subqueries do not receive bindings from the parent
 * and may be executed independently. By default, the subqueries are run with
 * unlimited parallelism.
 * <p>
 * UNION is useful when independent queries are evaluated and their outputs are
 * merged. Outputs from the UNION operator flow to the parent operator and will
 * be mapped across shards or nodes as appropriate for the parent. UNION runs on
 * the query controller. In order to avoid routing intermediate results through
 * the controller, the {@link PipelineOp.Annotations#SINK_REF} of each
 * child operand should be overridden to specify the parent of the UNION
 * operator.
 * <p>
 * UNION can not be used when the intermediate results must be routed into the
 * subqueries.  However, a {@link Tee} pattern may help in such cases.  For
 * example, a {@link Tee} may be used to create a union of pipeline joins for
 * two access paths during truth maintenance.
