/**
 * An aggregate operator, such as SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, etc.

 * @author thompsonbry
 * 
 * @todo In order to assign nice labels to select expressions we need to know
 *       (or be able to generate) the original syntactic expression, e.g.,
 *       <code>i+j<code> or <code>SUM(i*2)+j</code>. The textual value of these
 *       expressions will be used as if they were variable names. Since a
 *       subquery could be part of a SELECT expression, this means that we need
 *       to be able to do this for any SPARQL query construct.  I do not believe
 *       that openrdf currently supports this.
