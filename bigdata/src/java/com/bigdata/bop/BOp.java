/**
 * An operator, such as a constant, variable, join, sort, filter, etc.
 * <p>
 * Operators are organized in a tree of operators. The <i>arity</i> of an
 * operator is the number of child operands declared by that operator class. The
 * children of an operator are themselves operators. Parents reference their
 * children, but back references to the parents are not maintained.
 * <p>
 * In addition to their arguments, operators may have a variety of annotations,
 * including those specific to an operator (such as the maximum number of
 * iterators for a closure operator), those shared by many operators (such as
 * set of variables which are selected by a join or distributed hash table), or
 * those shared by all operators (such as a cost model).
 * <p>
 * Operators are effectively immutable (mutation APIs always return a deep copy
 * of the operator to which the mutation has been applied), {@link Serializable}
 * to facilitate distributed computing, and {@link Cloneable} to facilitate
 * non-destructive tree rewrites.
