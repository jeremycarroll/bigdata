/**
 * Operator quotes its operand (in the Lisp sense) and returns its operand when
 * it is evaluated. The purpose of quoting another operator is to prevent its
 * direct evaluation. This is typically done when the child operand will be
 * interpreted, rather than evaluated, within some context.

 * @deprecated I think that we can avoid quoting operators by using annotations
 *             (for some cases) and through explicit interaction between
 *             operators for others (such as between a join and a predicate). If
 *             that proves to be true then this class will be dropped.
