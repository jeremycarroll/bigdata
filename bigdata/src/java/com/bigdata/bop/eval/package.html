    This package provides an adaptive query optimization facility.
    Adaptive query optimization interleaves the execution of join
    paths in a query with the sampling of join paths in order to
    dynamically select join paths providing an efficient execution
    plan for the query.  Fast and accurate cardinality estimates are
    available based on range counts are used to decide which joins to
    execute first.  Without accurate knowledge of detailed correlation
    in joins, estimation error rapidly sets in as variable bindings
    are propagated.  Adaptive query optimization iteratively executes
    the join path identified as having lowest cost.  This execution
    phase is followed by a breadth first sampling of unexecuted join
    paths.  Join paths whose costs are dominated by a better solution
    are elimated.  Sampling of longer and longer join paths continues
    until one join path is found to have the lowest cost, at which
    point it is executed.  This approach is similar to the one
    described in <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1559845.1559910"
