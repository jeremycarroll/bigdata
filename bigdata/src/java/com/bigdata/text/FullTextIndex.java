/**
 * Full text indexing and search support.
 * <p>
 * The basic data model is consists of documents, fields in documents, and
 * tokens extracted by an analyzer from those fields.
 * <p>
 * The frequency distributions may be normalized to account for a varient of
 * effects producing "term weights". For example, normalizing for document
 * length or relative frequency of a term in the overall collection. Therefore
 * the logical model is:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *                                                    
 *   token : {docId, freq?, weight?}+
 *                                                    
 * </pre>
 * 
 * where docId happens to be the term identifier as assigned by the terms index.
 * The freq and weight are optional values that are representative of the kinds
 * of statistical data that are kept on a per-token-document basis. The freq is
 * the token frequency (the frequency of occurrence of the token in the
 * document). The weight is generally a normalized token frequency weight for
 * the token in that document in the context of the overall collection.
 * <p>
 * In fact, we actually represent the data as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *               
 *                {sortKey(token), fldId, docId} : {freq?, weight?, sorted(pos)+}
 *                        
 * </pre>
 * 
 * That is, there is a distinct entry in the full text B+Tree for each field in
 * each document in which a given token was recognized. The text of the token is
 * not stored in the key, just the Unicode sort key generated from the token
 * text. The value associated with the B+Tree entry is optional - it is simply
 * not used unless we are storing statistics for the token-document pair. The
 * advantages of this approach are: (a) it reuses the existing B+Tree data
 * structures efficiently; (b) we are never faced with the possibility overflow
 * when a token is used in a large number of documents. The entries for the
 * token will simply be spread across several leaves in the B+Tree; (c) leading
 * key compression makes the resulting B+Tree very efficient; and (d) in a
 * scale-out range partitioned index we can load balance the resulting index
 * partitions by choosing the partition based on an even token boundary.
 * <p>
 * A field is any pre-identified text container within a document. Field
 * identifiers are integers, so there are <code>32^2</code> distinct possible
 * field identifiers. It is possible to manage the field identifers through a
 * secondary index, but that has no direct bearing on the structure of the full
 * text index itself. Field identifies appear after the token in the key so that
 * queries may be expressed that will be matched against any field in the
 * document. Likewise, field identifiers occur before the document identifier in
 * the key since we always search across documents (the document identifier is
 * always 0L in the search keys). There are many applications for fields: for
 * example, distinct fields may be used for the title, abstract, and full text
 * of a document or for the CDATA section of each distinct element in documents
 * corresponding to some DTD. The application is responsible for recognizing the
 * fields in the document and producing the appropriate token stream, each of
 * which must be tagged by the field.
 * <p>
 * A query is tokenized, producing a (possibly normalized) token-frequency
 * vector identifical. The relevance of documents to the query is generally
 * taken as the cosine between the query's and each document's (possibly
 * normalized) token-frequency vectors. The main effort of search is assembling
 * a token frequency vector for just those documents with which there is an
 * overlap with the query. This is done using a key range scan for each token in
 * the query against the full text index.
 * 
 * <pre>
 *                    fromKey := token, 0L
 *                    toKey   := successor(token), 0L
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and extracting the appropriate token frequency, normalized token weight, or
 * other statistic. When no value is associated with the entry we follow the
 * convention of assuming a token frequency of ONE (1) for each document in
 * which the token appears.
 * <p>
 * Tokenization is informed by the language code for a {@link Literal} (when
 * declared) and by the configured {@link Locale} for the database otherwise. An
 * appropriate {@link Analyzer} is choosen based on the language code or
 * {@link Locale} and the "document" is broken into a token-frequency
 * distribution (alternatively a set of tokens). The same process is used to
 * tokenize queries, and the API allows the caller to specify the language code
 * used to select the {@link Analyzer} to tokenize the query.
 * <p>
 * Once the tokens are formed the language code / {@link Locale} used to produce
 * the token is discarded (it is not represented in the index). The reason for
 * this is that we never utilize the total ordering of the full text index,
 * merely the manner in which it groups tokens that map onto the same Unicode
 * sort key together. Further, we use only a single Unicode collator
 * configuration regardless of the language family in which the token was
 * originally expressed. Unlike the collator used by the terms index (which
 * often is set at IDENTICAL strength), the collector used by the full text
 * index should be choosen such that it makes relatively few distinctions in
 * order to increase recall (e.g., set at PRIMARY strength). Since a total order
 * over the full text index is not critical from the perspective of its IR
 * application, the {@link Locale} for the collator is likewise not critical and
 * PRIMARY strength will produce significantly shorter Unicode sort keys.
 * <p>
 * A map from tokens extracted from {@link Literal}s to the term identifiers of
 * the literals from which those tokens were extracted.
 * 
 * The term frequency within that literal is an optional property associated
 * with each term identifier, as is the computed weight for the token in the
 * term.
 * <p>
 * Note: Documents should be tokenized using an {@link Analyzer} appropriate for
 * their declared language code (if any). However, once tokenized, the language
 * code is discarded and we perform search purely on the Unicode sort keys
 * resulting from the extracted tokens.
 * 
 * @todo verify that PRIMARY US English is an acceptable choice for the full
 *       text index collator regardless of the language family in which the
 *       terms were expressed and in which search is performed. I.e., that the
 *       specific implementations retain some distinction among characters
 *       regardless of their code points
 *       (http://unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Legal_Code_Points indicates that they
 *       SHOULD).
 * 
 * @todo we will get relatively little compression on the fldId or docId
 *       component in the key using just leading key compression. A Hu-Tucker
 *       encoding of those components would be much more compact. Note that the
 *       encoding must be reversable since we need to be able to read the docId
 *       out of the key in order to retrieve the document.
 * 
 * @todo refactor the full text index into a general purpose bigdata service
 * 
 * @todo support normalization passes over the index in which the weights are
 *       updated based on aggregated statistics.
