/**
 * An address encodes both an int32 length and an int32 offset into a single
 * long integer. This limits the addressable size of a file to int32 bytes
 * (actually, only 2^31 bytes, e.g., 2G, since Java is using signed integers),
 * but that limit far exceeds the envisoned capacity of a single file in the
 * bigdata architecture. Note that the long integer ZERO (0L) is reserved and
 * always has the semantics of a <em>null</em> reference. Writes at offset
 * zero are allowed, depending on the store, by writes of zero length are
 * disallowed and hence no address will ever be ZERO (0L).
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo consider address segments to support fast combination of buffers each
 *       containing its own address space. A prime candidate for this is the
 *       {@link IndexSegmentBuilder} which currently jumps through hoops in
 *       order to make the nodes resolvable. When considering segments, note
 *       that addresses may currently be directly tested for order since the
 *       offset is in the high int32 word.
