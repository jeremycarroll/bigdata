/**
 * <p>
 * A low-level interface for reading and writing data. This interface is not
 * isolated and operations do not possess ACID semantics. Implementations may or
 * may not be durable. All operations are expressed in terms of long integers,
 * constructed and examined using {@link Addr}, that encode both the offset on
 * the store at which the data exists and the length of the data in bytes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link Journal} is the principle implementation of this interface and
 * provides both transient and durable options and the facilities for atomic
 * commit. {@link BTree} provides a higher level interface for operations on a
 * {@link Journal}. The {@link BTree} uses a copy-on-write policy designed to
 * support transactional semantics by making it possible to read from a
 * consistent historical state.
 * </p>

 * @see Addr
 * @see Journal
 * @see BTree
 * 
 * @todo It is possible to implement this interface using an int64 address space
 *       without embedding the record length into the address. this will require
 *       a means to translate from logical addresses to physical addresses. we
 *       could use a copy-on-write btree for that purpose. delete() should be
 *       defined so that we can release storage that is no longer required for
 *       data versions that can be accessed by any current transaction
 *       (supporting gc). a free list should offer fast best-fit or good fit
 *       access to chunks in the store that are available for reuse. this would
 *       make it possible for us to implement a scale up store based on a single
 *       monolithic file.
