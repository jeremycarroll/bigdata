/**
 * <p>
 * A low-level interface for reading and writing data. This interface is not
 * isolated and operations do not possess ACID semantics. Implementations may or
 * may not be durable. All operations are expressed in terms of long integers
 * that are often called "addresses" but which should be understood as opaque
 * identifiers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link AbstractJournal} is the principle implementation of this interface
 * and provides both transient and durable options and the facilities for atomic
 * commit. {@link BTree} provides a higher level interface for operations on an
 * {@link IRawStore} and uses a copy-on-write policy designed to support
 * transactional semantics by making it possible to read from a consistent
 * historical state. The {@link AbstractJournal} provides the necessary
 * mechansims to support transactions based on the copy-on-write semantics of
 * the {@link BTree}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link IRawStore} supports write and read back on immutable addresses and
 * does NOT directly support update of data for an immutable address once that
 * data has been written. Applications seeking Create, Read, Update, Delete
 * (CRUD) semantics should use a {@link BTree} to map from persistent object
 * identifiers to their application data objects. Unlike this interface, the
 * {@link BTree} can correctly support update and delete of application data
 * using a persistent identifier.
 * </p>

 * @see BTree
 * 
 * @todo The existing implementations of this interface do NOT support the
 *       release and reuse of allocated records - that is, they are all
 *       {@link IWORM Write Once Read Many} stores rather than read/write
 *       stores. A read-write implementation of this interface is of course
 *       possible and will require a means to allocate, release, and reallocate
 *       chunks of varying sizes within the store. Those chunks may either be
 *       drawn from a set of fixed sized allocation pools spanning a variety of
 *       useful record sizes or can use a stategy where records are allocated on
 *       an exact fit basis the first time and reallocated on a best/good fit
 *       basis. A free list can offer fast best-fit or good fit access to chunks
 *       in the store that are available for reuse. Any such approach must
 *       serialize allocations by one means or another, even though different
 *       allocation pools might be used concurrently. A delete() operation on
 *       {@link IRawStore} should be defined so that we can release storage that
 *       is no longer required for data versions that can not be accessed by any
 *       current transaction (a gc strategy). This would make it possible for us
 *       to implement a scale up store based on a single monolithic file.
 * 
 * FIXME The use of the {@link ByteBuffer} in this API has become limiting. It
 * would be nicer to specify a byte[] with optional offset and length
 * parameters. This would make it easier to wrap the byte[] in different ways
 * for reading and writing. The {@link ByteBuffer} has an advantage when reading
 * since it allows us to return a read-only view of the record, but in practice
 * that is only effective for an in-memory store (with or without a backing
 * file). The byte[] is more flexible.  The caller is free to reuse the byte[]
 * and the store always copies the data.
