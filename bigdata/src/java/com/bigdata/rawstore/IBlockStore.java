/**
 * An interface that supports streaming reads or writes of large blocks on a
 * store. The size of a block is limited to the maximum record size for the
 * backing store. In general, the maximum record size is a provisioning option
 * for the store.
 * <p>
 * Note: This interface does not support arbitrary length BLOBs. The reason is
 * that the architecture always limits by design the size of the artifacts that
 * have to be moved around to support a scale-out database. However, support for
 * BLOBs may be build on {@link IBlockStore}s. See {@link BigdataFileSystem}.
 * 
 * @deprecated This interface was never put into place. Instead I have added a
 *             means to read a block from an {@link ITuple} and an
 *             {@link IDataService}.  Writes of blocks are performed through the
 *             standard {@link IIndexProcedure} mechansims at this time, e.g., 
 *             see the {@link BigdataFileSystem}.
