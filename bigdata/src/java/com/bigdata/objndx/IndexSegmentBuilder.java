/**
 * Builds an {@link IndexSegment} given a source btree and a target branching
 * factor. There are two main use cases:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Evicting a key range of an index into an optimized on-disk index. In
 * this case, the input is a {@link BTree} that is ideally backed by a fully
 * buffered {@link IRawStore} so that no random reads are required.</li>
 * <li>Merging index segments. In this case, the input is typically records
 * emerging from a merge-sort. There are two distinct cases here. In one, we
 * simply have raw records that are being merged into an index. This might occur
 * when merging two key ranges or when external data are being loaded. In the
 * other case we are processing two timestamped versions of an overlapping key
 * range. In this case, the more recent version may have "delete" markers
 * indicating that a key present in an older version has been deleted in the
 * newer version. Also, key-value entries in the newer version replaced (rather
 * than are merged with) key-value entries in the older version. If an entry
 * history policy is defined, then it must be applied here to cause key-value
 * whose retention is no longer required by that policy to be dropped.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * Note: In order for the stack to be written in a contiguous block we either
 * have to buffer them in memory or have to write them onto a temporary file and
 * then copy them into place after the last leaf has been processed. The code
 * currently uses a temporary file for this purpose. This space demand was not
 * present in West's algorithm because it did not attempt to place the leaves
 * contiguously onto the store.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @see "Post-order B-Tree Construction" by Lawerence West, ACM 1992. Note that
 *      West's algorithm is for a b-tree (values are stored on internal stack as
 *      well as leaves), not a b+-tree (values are stored only on the leaves).
 *      Our implementation is therefore an adaptation.
 * 
 * @see "Batch-Construction of B+-Trees" by Kim and Won, ACM 2001. The approach
 *      outlined by Kim and Won is designed for B+-Trees, but it appears to be
 *      less efficient on first glance.
 * 
 * FIXME use the shortest separator key.
 * 
 * @todo Support merging index segments. This will probably be a merge sort
 *       using two leaf scans in parallel followed by a scan over the merged
 *       result that builds the index segment. The latter leaf scan will be
 *       somewhat special but is required since we need to known the actual #of
 *       entries before we can build the tree. Alternatively, we could just
 *       compute the #of entries and then run two leaf scans merging as we build
 *       the index segment itself.
 * 
 * @todo Support external sorting? This is tricky since the key and value data
 *       type and comparator must have exactly the same semantics as in the
 *       {@link IBTree} which is a bit much to expect from an external sort
 *       routine. Also, since the data are pre-ordered a merging scan seems
 *       likely to be far more efficient.
