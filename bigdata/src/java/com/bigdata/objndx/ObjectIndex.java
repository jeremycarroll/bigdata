/**
 * FIXME This needs to implement the object index semantics and provide a
 * strongly typed API. We could just hide the btree as a field rather than
 * extending it. The easy way to get the object index semantics is using a one
 * for one substitution of the btree for a {@link TreeMap} in
 * {@link SimpleObjectIndex}. We also need to write and apply a test suite and
 * test the journal using the persistence capable object index and not just the
 * {@link SimpleObjectIndex}.
 * 
 * @todo Review the logic that isolations mutations on the object index. For
 *       example, a delete of an object does not remove an entry from the base
 *       object index but rather records that the object is marked as deleted in
 *       that entry. When the isolated object index is merged down onto the
 *       global object index entries for objects that are marked as deleted are
 *       then deleted on the global index. When the transaction commits, the
 *       state change in the global index is atomically committed.
 * 
 * @todo Verify that we cause the storage allocated to the object index to be
 *       released when it is not longer accessible, e.g., the transaction
 *       commits or objects have been deleted and are no longer visible so we
 *       now remove their entries from the object index -- this can cause leaves
 *       and nodes in the object index to become empty, at which point they are
 *       deleted.
 * 
 * @todo Consider whether a call back "IValueSetter" would make it possible to
 *       update the value on the leaf in a more sophisticated manner. E.g.,
 *       rather than having to lookup to see if a value exists and then insert
 *       the value, we could pass in a lamba expression that gets evaluated in
 *       context and is able to distinguish between a value that did not exist
 *       and one that does exist. Ideally we could offer three options at that
 *       point : test, set, and delete, but just test/set is fine for most
 *       purposes since remove(key) has the same effect.
