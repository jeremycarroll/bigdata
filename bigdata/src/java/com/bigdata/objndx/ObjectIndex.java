/**
 * <p>
 * B+Tree persistent indexing data structure. B+Trees are optimized for
 * block-based, random I/O storage because they store multiple keys on one tree
 * node (called <code>Node</code>). In addition, the leaf nodes directly
 * contain (inline) the values associated with the keys, allowing a single (or
 * sequential) disk read of all the values on the page.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * B+Trees are n-airy, yeilding log(N) search cost. They are self-balancing,
 * preventing search performance degradation when the size of the tree grows.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Keys and associated values must be <code>Serializable</code> objects. The
 * user is responsible to supply a serializable <code>Comparator</code> object
 * to be used for the ordering of entries, which are also called
 * <code>Tuple</code>. The B+Tree allows traversing the keys in forward and
 * reverse order using a TupleBrowser obtained from the browse() methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation does not directly support duplicate keys, but it is
 * possible to handle duplicates by inlining or referencing an object collection
 * as a value.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There is no limit on key size or value size, but it is recommended to keep
 * both as small as possible to reduce disk I/O. This is especially true for the
 * key size, which impacts all non-leaf <code>Node</code> objects.

 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * FIXME The object index has to be intrinsically aware of isolation. Like
 * versions, the object index MUST NOT overwrite pre-existing data or the store
 * will be inconsistent after a crash. For a node that has not been written on
 * in the current isolation context (aka "clean"), changes to the object index
 * need to use copy on write with conditional deallocation of the old slots.
 * Copy on write requires that we clone a node on which we have a read-only
 * view, including all nodes up to the root. Copy on write results in a single
 * tree in which modifications are visible with read through to untouched nodes
 * in the base index. <br>
 * Once a node is modified within a transactional scope it may be freely
 * re-written until that isolation context commits. During the commit, the base
 * object index is written on - again using copy on write and conditional
 * deallocation. This ensures that a failure during commit does not leave the
 * object index in an incoherent state due to partial update. The new root of
 * the object index is written into the commit block, together with the new head
 * of the slots chain. Thereafter a restart will utilize the new object index
 * and the new slot chain. Conditional deallocation is achieved since the slots
 * are marked as deleted on the slot chain using copy on write (this needs to be
 * proved out).<br>
 * 
 * @todo Work through merge down during commit [ The base object index can be a
 *       btree with fixed size node serialization as describe above. The precise
 *       design for the object index with a transaction is less clear. The
 *       existing code uses a transient hash table. This design could work well
 *       using a version of a hash table that supports concurrent modification
 *       (or otherwise concurrent modifications during traversal during
 *       validation). Commit processing then merges down the transient isolated
 *       object index using copy on write onto the base object index. The
 *       drawbacks of this design are that it may incur a lot of object
 *       allocation to support the object index growth during the transaction
 *       and that it does not use a persistence capable data structure for
 *       transactions, so the memory footprint of a transaction will grow as a
 *       function of the #of objects written.<br>
 *       However, making the transaction isolation object index also persistence
 *       capable also has its challenges. If we copy the base index in response
 *       to writes on objects stored in uncloned nodes of the base index, then
 *       the isolated index size could (a) grow very quickly depending on the
 *       locality of the objects written on; and (b) store all object mappings
 *       in copied nodes rather than just those on which the transaction has
 *       actually written - this could also make it more expensive to validate
 *       since we need to scan more entries in order to find those that were
 *       written on by the tx. The plausible alternative is to use a persistence
 *       capable object index supporting concurrent modification (or buffering
 *       concurrent modifications arising from validation) and only store
 *       objects written on by the tx in that index.]
 * 
 * @todo (No, we can just buffer index changes during validation.) Support
 *       concurrent modification of the index structure (e.g., splitting,
 *       joining, and rotation of nodes) during traversal? Since copy on write
 *       gives us isolation level, support for concurrent modification is only
 *       concerned with structural changes within a given isolation level. This
 *       is necessary for the object index during validation. However, that case
 *       can be handled by buffering with transient data structures.
 * 
 * @todo Should there be a unique node identifier that is unchanging to
 *       facilitate cache mechanisms? The problem is that there is no persistent
 *       identifier for a node right now since its slot allocation changes each
 *       time it is written. If we can create a persistent identifier, then we
 *       can use normal cache mechanisms. The cache itself needs to be layered
 *       or otherwise deal with a transaction finding its copy-on-write versions
 *       of index nodes rather than those in the base object index. The total
 *       #of index nodes will continue to rise over time (owing to creation of
 *       new nodes during transactions).  However, a long integer might well
 *       suffice.
 * 
 * @todo Convert API and data structures from Integer to int. This is an
 *       optimization and does not effect the basic logic.
 * 
 * @todo Add index node caching. This is essential, but also a bit tricky. The
 *       {@link Journal}, by design, only performs sequential writes (depending
 *       on the buffer mode, reads may be either fully buffered or read through
 *       a page cache to disk). The index node cache is responsible for
 *       deferring the write of index nodes until they are evicted from the
 *       cache, thereby preserving the sequential write nature of the
 *       {@link Journal}. This has several implications. One is that we need a
 *       hard reference to a node until it has been written onto the journal, at
 *       which point we obtain its {@link ISlotAllocation} and we can release
 *       the hard reference. Another is that a node, once written, becomes
 *       immutable. Since we never perform random writes we can not update the
 *       data in the node's slot allocation. Instead, we have to clone the node
 *       into a mutable transient object. When we finally write the node on the
 *       end of the journal, it again gets a {@link ISlotAllocation} and we MUST
 *       break the hard reference, forcing the index to obtain a mutable view if
 *       it needs to write on the node.<br>
 *       There are three cases for persistent nodes: 1) a newly created node for
 *       which there is no prior version on the journal; 2) a clone of a node
 *       that was written during the current isolation context, in which case
 *       prior version is immediately deallocated on the journal; and 3) a clone
 *       of a node that is part of the base object index - the prior version of
 *       the node can not be deleted until the current isolation context commits
 *       since it is part of the last consistent object index state and will be
 *       in use if the isolation context is rolled back. <br>
 * 
 * @todo We do not need a full MRU for a weak reference cache. Instead, the hard
 *       reference cache can be a strongly typed array of references to the
 *       nodes. The start/end index of the array are tracked, making it into a
 *       ring buffer. The last N enties are tested before appending to the ring
 *       buffer to avoid appends of recently written references. Objects are
 *       marked as dirty when they are added to the hard reference cache. When
 *       they are evicted, the dirty flag is tested and they are serialized iff
 *       they are still dirty. In this manner, repeated evictions of the same
 *       object do not cause repeated serializations. (This should work well
 *       with the copy on write semantics.) See {@link HardReferenceCache}.
 * 
 * @todo The #of non-leaf nodes (and the space required to store them) is quite
 *       small for the bigdata use cases. We should differentiate between cache
 *       for non-leaf and leaf nodes. Leave nodes do require cache, both for key
 *       scans and for frequently accessed objects (to avoid any disk hits on
 *       the index). Ideally, we always cache non-leaf nodes. However, the #of
 *       leave nodes in cache probably needs to be more limited. We could create
 *       one cache for leaves and one for non-leafs. Those caches could even
 *       have similar capacities since the key concerns are (a) enough capacity
 *       for non-leaf nodes; and (b) leaf churn should not drive non-leaf nodes
 *       out of cache.
 * 
 * @todo Provide an option to read the non-leaf index into memory during
 *       restart, which will require random IOs iff we are not fully buffered.
