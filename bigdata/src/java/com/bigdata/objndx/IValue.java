/**
 * Interface for values in an {@link AbstractBTree} supporting deletion markers
 * and version counters.
 * <p>
 * Deletion markers are required by both transactions (so that the entry may be
 * removed from the unisolated tree when the transaction commits) and
 * partitioned indices (so that a key deleted in an unisolated index may be
 * removed during a compacting merge with existing index segments).
 * <p>
 * Version counters are required in order to support transactional isolation of
 * an index. The version counter is incremented on each write on the unisolated
 * tree. When a transaction isolates an index it does so by creating a fused
 * view that reads from a historical committed state of the corresponding
 * unisolated index and writes on an isolated index. When a value is written on
 * in the isolated index, the version counter from the unisolated index is
 * copied into the isolated index. When the transaction commits, it validates
 * the writes by testing the version counter in the then current unisolated
 * index. If the version counter for an entry in the isolated index does not
 * agree with the version counter on the unisolated index then an intervening
 * commit has already overwritten that entry and a write-write conflict exists.
 * Either the write-write conflict can be resolved or the transaction must
 * abort. In the special case where there are no intervening commits since the
 * transaction began validation is unecessary and should be skipped.
 * <p>
 * A delete is handled as a write that sets a "deleted" flag. Eventually the
 * keys for deleted entries are removed from the index. When a partitioned index
 * is used, delete markers are retained until the next compacting merge. When
 * partitioned indices are not used, the key is simply removed from the
 * unisolated index when transaction merges its writes down onto the unisolated
 * index. In either case, note that the next write on an unisolated index after
 * the delete marker has been processed (and the corresponding key has been
 * removed from the index) will once again assign a version counter of ONE (1).
 * The reuse of version counters will not cause a problem since transactions are
 * always isolated with respect to a specific historical committed state (the
 * most recent committed state before the transaction starts).

     * A counter that is updated to detect write-write conflicts.
     * <p>
     * The counter is always incremented when a new version is written in an
     * unisolated index (the first write on the unisolated index outside of any
     * transaction must set the counter to ONE (1) in order to correctly detect
     * a conflict with a concurrent transaction). When an index is isolated by a
     * transaction, the version counter is copied into the isolated index the
     * first time a value for a given key is written on the isolated index (the
     * counter is set to ZERO(0) if the key was not found in the unisolated
     * index, which will turn into a counter of ONE (1) iff the transaction
     * successfully validates and commits).
     * <p>
     * When the transaction validates, a write-write conflict exists iff the
     * value of the counter in the then current unisolated index is not equal to
     * the value in the within the insolated index. This always indicates that a
     * newer version has been committed. If the conflict can not be validated,
     * e.g., by a merge rule, then validation will fail and the transaction will
     * abort. The counter is always incremented when an entry in an isolated
     * index is merged down onto the then current unisolated index.
     * <p>
     * Note that version counters do rollover. A version counter is only a short
     * integer and one bit is reserved to flag a deleted key. When the counter
     * overflows it is reset to ONE (1) since that the value ZERO (0) is
     * reserved to indicate a key that has never been written on the unisolated
     * index. However, since the rule for detecting a write-write conflict is
     * that the version counters do not agree it would require exactly 32k-1 (
     * 32,767 ) <em>concurrent</em> overwrites of a value to create a
     * situation in which a write-write conflict would be missed. It is not
     * envisioned that any transaction will live long enough for there to be at
     * least this many intervening concurrent transactions. However, to be
     * absolutely safe, a transaction should be aborted if at least this many
     * intervening transactions have successfully committed. This seems a
     * reasonable limit on long-running transactions.
