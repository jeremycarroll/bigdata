/**
 * Interface for operations on an ordered set of keys. Each key is a variable
 * length unsigned byte[]. Keys are considered to be <em>immutable</em>,
 * though this is NOT enforced. Several aspects of the code assume that a byte[]
 * key is NOT modified once it has been created. This makes it possible to copu
 * references to keys rather than allocating new byte[]s and copying the data.
 * There are mutable and immutable implementations of this interface.
 * 
 * @todo This code is optimized for very long variable length unsigned byte[]s.
 *       It will be much less efficient that direct comparison when the key is a
 *       simple int or long integer value (including a float or double which can
 *       be expressed in the int and long spaces respectively). Provide an
 *       alternative realization of the btree that is efficient for these
 *       special cases for use in, e.g., an embedded object database
 *       application.
