/**
 * Class supporting a compacting merge of two btrees into a series of ordered
 * leaves on a temporary file in support of a compacting merge of mutable
 * {@link BTree}s and/or immutable {@link IndexSegment}s.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo write tests: merging a tree with itself, merging trees w/o deletion
 *       markers, merging trees w/ deletion markers, merging trees w/ age-based
 *       version expiration, merging trees with count-based version expiration.
 * 
 * @todo Support delete during merge to support transactions (a TimestampValue
 *       having a greater timestamp and a null value is interpreted as a delete
 *       marker).
 * 
 * @todo Support deletion based on history policy (requires timestamps in the
 *       keys and explicit awareness of column store nature).
 * 
 * @todo factor out the merge rule into the {@link BTreeMetadata}. consider
 *       whether it should be maintained on the {@link IndexSegmentMetadata} as
 *       well.
 * 
 * FIXME rewrite to use {@link IRawStore} objects as buffers ala the
 * {@link IndexSegmentBuilder} and see if we are better off using memory or disk
 * to buffer the merge.
 * 
 * @see {@link FusedView}, which provides a dynamic view of two or more btrees.
 *      However, this class is more efficient when we are going to do a bulk
 *      merge operation since it performs the merge and computes the #of output
 *      entries in one pass.
