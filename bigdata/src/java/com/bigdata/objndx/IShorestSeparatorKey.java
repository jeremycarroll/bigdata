/**
 * A notional interface that an application may implement in order to minimize
 * the length of the keys that are stored in the non-leaf nodes of a
 * {@link IBTree} having <em>variable length keys</em>.
 * 
 * This operation is invoked when a leaf is split or when keys must be
 * redistributed between two leaves that are siblings of some common parent
 * node. At those times the separatorKey in the parent node must be choosen.
 * When variable length keys are used, the choice can produce shorter keys in
 * nodes that are the immediate parents of leaves. For example, assuming that
 * you have an index with variable length character data as keys:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *      leaf:    [ motivate, movie, moving, mower ]
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This leaf will be split at index 2 as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *      leaf:    [ motivate, movie, -, - ]
 *      sibling: [ moving, mower, -, - ]
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The separator key MUST be less than or equal to "moving" and strictly greater
 * than "movie". If we choose the shortest successor of "movie" that is not
 * greater than "moving" the separator key would be "movie\0" (the successor of
 * "movie") rather than "moving". This would save one (1) character in the
 * separatorKey.
 * 
 * Note that this trick can not be used at higher levels in the btree.

 * @deprecated I rate this feature as not worth while. It was originally
 *             described by Bayer and Unterauer in "Prefix B-Trees". Their
 *             concern was to reduce the height of the tree by compacting more
 *             data into a page and for the index nodes. We are achieving
 *             similar means through other devices, notably allowing the page
 *             size to vary while fixing the branching factor and using large
 *             branching factors and compression in {@link IndexSegments}.
