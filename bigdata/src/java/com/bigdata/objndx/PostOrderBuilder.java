/**
 * Class supports a post-order construction of a "perfect" b+tree given sorted
 * records. There are two main use cases:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Evicting a key range of an index into an optimized on-disk index. In
 * this case, the input is a btree that is ideally backed by a fully buffered
 * {@link IRawStore} so that no random reads are required.</li>
 * <li>Merging index segments. In this case, the input is typically records
 * emerging from a merge-sort. There are two distinct cases here. In one, we
 * simply have raw records that are being merged into an index. This might occur
 * when merging two key ranges or when external data are being loaded. In the
 * other case we are processing two timestamped versions of an overlapping key
 * range. In this case, the more recent version may have "delete" markers
 * indicating that a key present in an older version has been deleted in the
 * newer version. Also, key-value entries in the newer version replaced (rather
 * than are merged with) key-value entries in the older version. If an entry
 * history policy is defined, then it must be applied here to cause key-value
 * whose retention is no longer required by that policy to be dropped.</li>

 * FIXME West's algorithm is for a b-tree, not a b+-tree. Therefore it assumes
 * that there are key-value pairs in all nodes of the tree rather than in just
 * the leaves of the tree. This will require a pervasive adaptation in order to
 * work. The approach outlined by Kim and Won is designed for B+-Trees, but it
 * appears to be less efficient on first glance.
 * 
 * FIXME Implement the post-order builder. Support each of the use cases,
 * including external sorting. Write a package to support lookups on the
 * generated perfect indices, including buffering the nodes in memory and
 * optionally buffering the leaves as well. To what extent can we reuse the
 * btree package for these read-only indices and just swap out the
 * {@link IRawStore} implementation?

     * that:
     * 
     * <pre>
     *   2(d + 1)&circ;(h-l) - 1 &lt;= N &lt;= (2d + 1)&circ;h - l

     * <li>h := the height of the generated tree (origin one (1)).</li>
     * <li>N := the #of entries (rows of data)</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * This can be restated as:
     * 
     * <pre>
     *  
     *   2(m/2 + 1)&circ;h - 1 &lt;= N &lt;= (m + 1)&circ;(h+1) - l

     *       be unchanging during this process. This suggests that it is best to
     *       freeze the journal, opening a new journal for continued writes, and
     *       then evict all index ranges in the frozen journal into perfect
     *       indices.

     * @todo Note that this routine is limited to an index subrange with no more
     *       entries than can be represented in an int32 signed value.
