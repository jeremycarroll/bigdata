 * Interface for batch operations a B+-Tree mapping variable length unsigned

 * are executed in a single threaded context and are therefore atomic. A batch
 * api operation that does NOT span more than one index partition is therefore
 * atomic. However, if an operation spans multiple partitions of an index then
 * NO GUARENTEE is made that the operation is atomic over the set of index
 * partitions.
