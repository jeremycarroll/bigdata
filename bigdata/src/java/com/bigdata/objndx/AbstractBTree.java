     * Leaves are added to a hard reference queue when they are created or read

     * strongly reachable its weak references may be cleared by the VM. Note
     * that leaves are evicted as new leaves are added to the hard reference
     * queue. This occurs in two situations: (1) when a new leaf is created
     * during a split of an existing leaf; and (2) when a leaf is read in from
     * the store. The minimum capacity for the hard reference queue is two (2)
     * so that a split may occur without forcing eviction of either leaf in the
     * split. Incremental writes basically make it impossible for the commit IO
     * to get "too large" where too large is defined by the size of the hard
     * reference cache.
     * 
     * Note: The code in {@link Node#postOrderIterator(boolean)} and
     * {@link DirtyChildIterator} MUST NOT touch the hard reference queue since
     * those iterators are used when persisting a node using a post-order
     * traversal. If a hard reference queue eviction drives the serialization of
     * a node and we touch the hard reference queue during the post-order
     * traversal then we break down the semantics of
     * {@link HardReferenceQueue#append(Object)} as the eviction does not
     * necessarily cause the queue to reduce in length.
     * 
     * @todo This is all a bit fragile. Another way to handle this is to have
     *       {@link HardReferenceQueue#append(Object)} begin to evict objects
     *       before is is actually at capacity, but that is also a bit fragile.
     * 
     * @todo This queue is now used for both nodes and leaves. Update the
     *       javadoc here, in the constants that provide minimums and defaults
     *       for the queue, and in the other places where the queue is used or
     *       configured. Also rename the field to nodeQueue or refQueue.
     * 
     * @todo Consider breaking this into one queue for nodes and another for
     *       leaves. Would this make it possible to create a policy that targets
     *       a fixed memory burden for the index? As it stands the #of nodes and
     *       the #of leaves in memory can vary and leaves require much more
