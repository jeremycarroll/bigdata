 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo add nano timers and track storage used by the index. The goal is to
 *       know how much of the time of the server is consumed by the index,
 *       what percentage of the store is dedicated to the index, how
 *       expensive it is to do some scan-based operations (merged down,
 *       delete of transactional isolated persistent index), and evaluate
 *       the buffer strategy by comparing accesses with IOs.
