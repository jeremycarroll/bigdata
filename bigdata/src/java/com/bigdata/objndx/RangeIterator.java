/**
 * An iterator that visits key-value pairs in a half-open range.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * FIXME Implement the key range iterator. Optimize when using a read-only
 * {@link IndexSegment}. Support pre-fetch, next/prior traversal, etc.
 * 
 * @todo consider batch api that uses the range count to allocate arrays for the
 *       keys and values and then streams them back to the client en mass.
 * 
 * @todo Support iteration with concurrent structural modification. The iterator
 *       will have to listen for structural modifications and perhaps for insert /
 *       delete key operations on the current leaf.
 * 
 * @deprecated not in use at this time.
