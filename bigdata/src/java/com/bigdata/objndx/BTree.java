/**
 * <p>
 * This class implements a variant of a B+Tree in which all values are stored in
 * leaves, but the leaves are not connected with prior-next links. This
 * constraint arises from the requirement to support a copy-on-write policy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: No mechanism is exposed for recovering a node or leaf of the tree other
 * than the root by its key. This is because the parent reference on the node
 * (or leaf) can only be set when it is read from the store in context by its
 * parent node.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: the leaves can not be stitched together with prior and next references
 * without forming cycles that make it impossible to write out the leaves of the
 * btree. This restriction arises because each time we write out a node or leaf
 * it is assigned a persistent identifier as an unavoidable artifact of
 * providing isolation for the object index.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This implementation is NOT thread-safe. The index is intended for use
 * within a single-threaded context.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This iterators exposed by this implementation do NOT support concurrent
 * structural modification. Concurrent inserts or removals of keys MAY produce
 * incoherent traversal whether or not they result in addition or removal of
 * nodes in the tree.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @todo try changing the default branching factor in spo index to divide by 3
 *       or 6; try routing all arraycopy calls through a final method that
 *       handles small N or strongly typed moderate N locally. run through the
 *       call graph knocking out IO and see what is sucking down the cpu.
 * 
 * @todo indexOf, keyAt, valueAt need batch api compatibility (they use the old
 *       findChild, search, and autobox logic).
 * 
 * @todo keep the non-batch as well as the batch api or simplify to just the
 *       batch api?
 * 
 * @todo modify ibtree api to accept int[], etc. and do both single and batch
 *       operations with the same methods. require that the keys are in sorted
 *       order when nkeys in array is greater than one. add wrapper methods to
 *       allow operations with single Integer (for compatibility with the test
 *       cases) and possibly Long, etc. Modify the internals to use int[1] and
 *       not Integer for stride == 1?
 * 
 * @todo Multiple versions will not work unless the timestamp is _part_ of the
 *       key. The reason is that the ordering is defined by { key, timestamp }
 *       or for a column store { key, column, timestamp}. The separator keys
 *       MUST be able to guide search to the correct leaf, so the timestamp (or
 *       timestamp and column name) MUST be part of the separator keys, and
 *       hence they must be part of the full key as observed by the btree. This
 *       suggests using a general purpose key constructed from an application
 *       key, a column name, and a timestamp for a column store.<br>
 *       This means that timestamps may not be required for all leaves and could
 *       be elided when using the btree for a column store (vs for full
 *       transactional isolation). Another way to approach isolation is to make
 *       the timestamp part of the object when used for isolation. that results
 *       in more object creation, less data movement, and requires the wrapper
 *       to be imposed by the user of the btree so that they insert, lookup, and
 *       remove a time-marked application value. Handled this way, the btree is
 *       completely ignorant about timestamps for both column stores and
 *       transactional isolation. If I go this route this I will wind up
 *       dropping the timestamp from the batch API.
 * 
 * @todo Track the #of nodes and leaves on the hard reference queue in touch and
 *       {@link DefaultEvictionListener}. Also track the number that are clean
 *       vs dirty.
 * 
 * @todo Modify to support "stealing" of immutable nodes by wrapping them with a
 *       thin class encapsulating the {parent, btree} references and refactor
 *       the design until it permits an isolated btree to reuse the in memory
 *       nodes and leaves of the base btree in order to minimize the resource
 *       and IO costs of having multiple concurrent transactions running on the
 *       same journal.
 * 
 * @todo support the concept of a "stride" for fixed length arrays of primitive
 *       data keys, e.g., long[4]. This would treat each run of N values in
 *       {@link AbstractNode#keys} as a single key. The advantage is to minimize
 *       object creation for some kinds of keys, e.g., a triple or quad store or
 *       a fixed length byte[] or char[] such as char[64]. Note that long fixed
 *       length arrays are better off doing reference copying as they will be
 *       moving less data (how large is a Java reference anyway, 4 bytes?).
 * 
 * @todo drop the jdbm-based btree implementation in favor of this one and test
 *       out a GOM integration. this will also require an extser service /
 *       index. extser support could be handled using an extensible metadata
 *       record for the {@link BTree} or {@link IndexSegment}, at least for an
 *       embedded database scenario. http://xstream.codehaus.org/ is also an
 *       interesting serialization package with somewhat different goals (you do
 *       not have to write serializers, but it is doubtless less compact and
 *       does not have extensible versioning).
 * 
 * @todo Implement an "extser" index that does not use extser itself, but which
 *       could provide the basis for a database that does use extser. The index
 *       needs to map class names to entries. Those entries are a classId and
 *       set of {version : Serializer} entries.
 * 
 * @todo support dictionary order and alternative unicode collation sequences
 *       for char[n], char[*], and String data types. Note that a variable
 *       length char[] requires less space to represent the same data as a
 *       {@link String}.
 * 
 * @todo test object index semantics (clustered index of int32 or int64
 *       identifiers associate with inline objects and time/version stamps).
 *       There is a global index, and then one persistence capable index per
 *       transaction. The time/version stamps are used during validation to
 *       determine if there is a possible write-write conflict. The same kind of
 *       isolation should be provided for object and non-object indices. The
 *       only real difference is that the object index is using an int32 or
 *       int64 key.
 * 
 * @todo we could defer splits by redistributing keys to left/right siblings
 *       that are under capacity - this makes the tree a b*-tree. however, this
 *       is not critical since the journal is designed to be fully buffered and
 *       the index segments are read-only but it would reduce memory by reducing
 *       the #of nodes -- and we can expect that the siblings will be either
 *       resident or in the direct buffer for the journal
 * 
 * @todo consider using extser an option for serialization so that we can
 *       continually evolve the node and leaf formats. we will also need a node
 *       serializer that does NOT use extser in order to store the persistent
 *       extser mappings themselves, and perhaps for other things such as an
 *       index of the index ranges that are multiplexed on a given journal.
 *       finally, we will need to use extser to simplify reopening an index so
 *       that we can recover its key serializer, value serializer, and key
 *       comparator as well as various configuration values from its metadata
 *       record. that encapsulation will have to be layered over the basic btree
 *       class so that we can use a more parameterized btree instance to support
 *       extser itself. there will also need to be metadata maintained about the
 *       perfect index range segments so that we know how to decompress blocks,
 *       deserialize keys and values, and compare keys.
 * 
 * @todo model out the metadata index design to locate the components of an
 *       index key range. this will include the journal on which writes for the
 *       key range are multiplexed with other key ranges on either the same or
 *       other indices, any frozen snapshot of a journal that is being processed
 *       into index segment files, and those index segment files themselves. if
 *       a key range is always mapped (multiplexed) to a process on a host, then
 *       the historical journal snapshots and index key range files can be
 *       managed by the host rather than showing up in the metadata index
 *       directly.
 * 
 * @todo support column store style indices (key, column, timestamp), locality
 *       groups that partition the key space so that we can fully buffer parts
 *       of the index that matter, automated version history policies that
 *       expire old values based on either an external timestamp or write time
 *       on the server.
 * 
 * @todo support key range iterators that allow concurrent structural
 *       modification. structural mutations in a b+tree are relatively limited.
 *       When prior-next references are available, an iterator should be easily
 *       able to adjust for insertion and removal of keys.
 * 
 * @todo maintain prior-next references among leaves (and nodes?) in memory even
 *       if we are not able to write them onto the disk. when reading in a leaf,
 *       always set the prior/next reference iff the corresponding leaf is in
 *       memory - this is easily handled by checking the weak references on the
 *       parent node.
 * 
 * @todo support efficient insert of sorted data (batch or bulk insert).
 * 
 * @todo support efficient conditional inserts, e.g., if this key does not exist
 *       then insert this value.
 * 
 * @todo support key compression (prefix and suffix compression and split
 *       interval trickery).
 * 
 * @todo evict subranges by touching the node on the way up so that a node that
 *       is evicted from the hard reference cache will span a subrange that can
 *       be evicted together. this will help to preserve locality on disk. with
 *       this approach leaves might be evicted independently, but also as part
 *       of a node subrange eviction.
 * 
 * @todo since forward scans are much more common, change the post-order
 *       iterator for commit processing to use a reverse traversal so that we
 *       can write the next leaf field whenever we evict a sequence of leaves as
 *       part of a sub-range commit (probably not much of an issue since the
 *       journal is normally fully buffered and the perfect index segments will
 *       not have this problem).
 * 
 * @todo Actually, I could save both prior and next references using a
 *       hand-over-hand chaining in which I pre-serialize the leaf and separate
 *       the allocation step from the write on the store. With just a small
 *       change to the leaf serialization format so that I can write in the
 *       prior and next fields at a known location (which could even be the end
 *       of the buffer), I would then be able to persistent the prior/next
 *       references. <br>
 *       The first step is to start maintaining those references. Also, consider
 *       that it may be useful to maintain them at the node as well as the leaf
 *       level.
 * 
 * @todo pre-fetch leaves for range scans? this really does require asynchronous
 *       IO, which is not available for many platforms (it is starting to show
 *       up in linux 2.6 kernals).
 * 
 * @todo Note that efficient support for large branching factors requires a more
 *       sophisticated approach to maintaining the key order within a node or
 *       leaf. E.g., using a red-black tree or adaptive packed memory array.
 *       However, we can use smaller branching factors for btrees in the journal
 *       and use a separate implementation for bulk generating and reading
 *       "perfect" read-only key range segments.
 * 
 * @todo derive a string index that uses patricia trees in the leaves per
 *       several published papers.
 * 
 * @todo one way to increase performance while maintaining the separation of the
 *       control logic and the keyType is to use template classes, but I am not
 *       sure that this is worth it.

     * Interface for transactional isolation.
     * 
     * The basic design for isolation requires that reads are performed against
     * a historical committed state of the store (the ground state, which is
     * typically the last committed state of the store at the time that the
     * transaction begins) while writes are isolated (they are not visible
     * outside of the transaction). The basic mechanism for isolation is a
     * isolated btree that reads through to a read-only btree loaded from a
     * historical metadata record while writes go into the isolated btree. The
     * isolated btree is used by the transaction and never by another
     * transaction.
     * 
     * In order to commit, the transaction must validate the write set on the
     * isolated btree against the then current committed state of the btree. If
     * there have been no intervening commits then validation is a NOP since the
     * read-only btree that the isolated btree reads through to is the current
     * committed state. If there have been intervening commits, then validation
     * may identify write-write conflicts (read-write conflicts are obviated by
     * the basic design). A write-write conflict exists when a concurrent
     * transaction wrote a record for the same key as the transaction that is
     * being validated and has already committed (conflicts are not visible
     * until a writer has committed). Write-write conflicts may be resolved by
     * data type specific merge rules. Examples include debits and credits on a
     * bank account or conflicts on link set metadata but not state for a
     * generic object. If a conflict can not be validated then the transaction
     * is aborted and may be retried.
     * 
     * Once a transaction has validated it is merged down onto the globally
     * visible state of the btree. This process consists simply of applying the
     * changes to the globally visible btree, including both inserts of
     * key-value pairs and removal of keys that were deleted during the
     * transaction.
     * 
     * If a transaction is reading from or writing on more than one btree, then
     * it must validate the write set for each btree during its validation stage
     * and merge down the write set for each btree during its merge state. Once
     * this merge process is complete, the btree is flushed to the backing store
     * which results in a new metadata record. The mapping from btree identifier
     * to btree metadata record is then updated on the backing store. Finally,
     * an atomic commit is then performed on the backing store. At this point
     * the transaction has successfully completed.
     * 
     * @todo efficient sharing of nodes and leaves for concurrent read-only
     * views (stealing children vs wrapping them with a flyweight wrapper; reuse
     * of the same btree instance for reading from the same historical state).
     * 
     * @todo the read-only view must be against the partitioned index, not just
     * the btree on the journal. this makes life more complicated.
     * 
     * @todo handle journal overflow smoothly with respect to transactional
     * isolation, including how to handle both short and long-lived readers and
     * writers. draw some boundaries on what is supported and what is not.
     * 
     * @todo explore transaction designs for a distributed paritioned index.

     * error or should it be silently ignored?

//     * 
//     * @todo There are a few problems with this approach <br>
//     *       First, using a btree with MVCC requires that we record a timestamp
//     *       or version counter with each object in order to detect conflicts. This can be implemented using
//     *       either a wrapper class (VersionedBTree) that delegates to BTree and
//     *       encapsulates values as {value,timestamp} entries. Alternatively, we
//     *       could maintain version counters either full time or optionally in
//     *       all leaves as another int[] or long[], one per value. <br>
//     *       Second, we need a means to have active transactions span instances
//     *       of a journal (as each journal fills up it is eventually frozen, a
//     *       new journal is opened, and the indices from the old journal are
//     *       rebuilt in perfect read-only index segments on disk; those segments
//     *       are periodically compacted and segments that grow too large are
//     *       split). when we use a transient map to isolate writes then a
//     *       journal contains only committed state.<br>
//     *       Third, the isolated btree needs to start from the committed stable
//     *       state of another btree (a possible exception is the first
//     *       transaction to create a given btree). In order to verify that the
//     *       source btree meets those requirements we need to know that it was
//     *       loaded from a historical metadata record, e.g., as found in a root
//     *       block or a read-only root names index found in a root block. Merely
//     *       having a persistent root is NOT enough since just writing the tree
//     *       onto the store does not make it restart safe.<br>
//     *       Fourth, it would be very nice if we could reuse immutable nodes
//     *       from the last committed state of a given btree. However, we can not
//     *       simply use the BTree instance from the global state since
//     *       intervening writes will show up inside of its node set and the view
//     *       MUST be of a historical ground state.

//     * merge the write set of an index into the global scope. This operation
//     * does NOT check for conflicts. The pre-condition is that the transaction
//     * has already been validated (hence, there will be no conflicts). This
//     * method is also responsible for incrementing the version counters that are
//     * used to detect write-write conflicts during validation.
//     * </p>
//     * 
//     * @todo For a persistence capable implementation of the object index we
//     *       could clear currentVersionSlots during this operation since there
//     *       should be no further access to that field. The only time that we
//     *       will go re-visit the committed object index for the transaction is
//     *       when we GC the pre-existing historical versions overwritten during
//     *       that transaction. Given that, we do not even need to store the
//     *       object index root for a committed transaction (unless we want to
//     *       provide a feature for reading historical states, which is NOT part
//     *       of the journal design). So another option is to just write a chain
//     *       of {@link ISlotAllocation} objects. (Note, per the item below GC
//     *       also needs to remove entries from the global object index so this
//     *       optimization may not be practical). This could be a single long
//     *       run-encoded slot allocation spit out onto a series of slots during
//     *       PREPARE. When we GC the transaction, we just read the chain,
//     *       deallocate the slots found on that chain, and then release the
//     *       chain itself (it could have its own slots added to the end so that
//     *       it is self-consuming). Just pay attention to ACID deallocation so
//     *       that a partial operation does not have side-effects (at least, side
//     *       effects that we do not want). This might require a 3-bit slot
//     *       allocation index so that we can encode the conditional transition
//     *       from (allocated + committed) to (deallocated + uncommitted) and
//     *       know that on restart the state should be reset to (allocated +
//     *       committed).
//     * 
//     * @todo GC should remove the 'deleted' entries from the global object index
//     *       so that the index size does not grow without limit simply due to
//     *       deleted versions. This makes it theoretically possible to reuse a
//     *       persistent identifier once it has been deleted, is no longer
//     *       visible to any active transaction, and has had the slots
//     *       deallocated for its last valid version. However, in practice this
//     *       would require that the logic minting new persistent identifiers
//     *       received notice as old identifiers were expired and available for
//     *       reuse. (Note that applications SHOULD use names to recover root
//     *       objects from the store rather than their persistent identifiers.)
//     * 
//     * FIXME Validation of the object index MUST specifically treat the case
//     * when no version for a persistent identifier exists in the ground state
//     * for a tx, another tx begins and commits having written a version for that
//     * identifier, and then this tx attempts to commit having written (or
//     * written and deleted) a version for that identifier. Failure to treat this
//     * case will cause problems during the merge since there will be an entry in
//     * the global scope that was NOT visible to this transaction (which executed
//     * against a distinct historical global scope). My take is the persistent
//     * identifier assignment does not tend to have semantics (they are not
//     * primary keys, but opaque identifiers) therefore we MUST NOT consider them
//     * to be the same "object" and an unreconcilable write-write conflict MUST
//     * be reported during validation. (Essentially, two transactions were handed
//     * the same identifier for new objects.)
//     * 
//     * FIXME Think up sneaky test cases for this method and verify its operation
//     * in some detail.
