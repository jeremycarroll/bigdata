/**
 * <p>
 * This class implements a variant of a B+Tree in which all values are stored in
 * leaves, but the leaves are not connected with prior-next links. This
 * constraint arises from the requirement to support a copy-on-write policy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: No mechanism is exposed for recovering a node or leaf of the tree other
 * than the root by its key. This is because the parent reference on the node
 * (or leaf) can only be set when it is read from the store in context by its
 * parent node.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: the leaves can not be stitched together with prior and next references
 * without forming cycles that make it impossible to write out the leaves of the
 * btree. This restriction arises because each time we write out a node or leaf
 * it is assigned a persistent identifier as an unavoidable artifact of
 * providing isolation for the object index.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This implementation is NOT thread-safe. The index is intended for use
 * within a single-threaded context.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This iterators exposed by this implementation do NOT support concurrent
 * structural modification. Concurrent inserts or removals of keys MAY produce
 * incoherent traversal whether or not they result in addition or removal of
 * nodes in the tree.
 * </p>
 * 
 * FIXME do incremental evictions of nodes as well as leaves and verify that the
 * heap does not grow unruly for extended inserts.
 * 
 * @todo Profile the heap and the code and determine if we are spending too much
 *       time autoboxing when using a primitive key type, notably int[] or
 *       long[].
 * 
 * @todo we could defer splits by redistributing keys to left/right siblings
 *       that are under capacity - this makes the tree a b*-tree. however, this
 *       is not critical since the journal is designed to be fully buffered and
 *       the index segments are read-only but it would reduce memory by reducing
 *       the #of nodes -- and we can expect that the siblings will be either
 *       resident or in the direct buffer for the journal
 * 
 * @todo should this btree should intrinsically support isolation of inline
 *       objects by carrying the necessary metadata for each index entry. note
 *       that the original isolation scheme effectively carried references to
 *       the objects on the journal (slot allocations) rather than having them
 *       inline. we probably do not need to know where the historical versions
 *       is since we only need to release it on the journal if we are trying to
 *       keep a single file and reuse deallocated space. if we just discard
 *       entire journal extents once their data has been migrated into perfect
 *       segments then we never need to do that deallocation. this leaves us
 *       with a version counter (similar to a timestamp, and perhaps replaceable
 *       by a timestamp) and the object itself. if we make the timestamp part of
 *       the key, then all that we are left with is the object itself.
 * 
 * @todo consider using extser an option for serialization so that we can
 *       continually evolve the node and leaf formats. we will also need a node
 *       serializer that does NOT use extser in order to store the persistent
 *       extser mappings themselves, and perhaps for other things such as an
 *       index of the index ranges that are multiplexed on a given journal.
 *       finally, we will need to use extser to simplify reopening an index so
 *       that we can recover its key serializer, value serializer, and key
 *       comparator as well as various configuration values from its metadata
 *       record. that encapsulation will have to be layered over the basic btree
 *       class so that we can use a more parameterized btree instance to support
 *       extser itself. there will also need to be metadata maintained about the
 *       perfect index range segments so that we know how to decompress blocks,
 *       deserialize keys and values, and compare keys.
 * 
 * @todo model out the metadata index design to locate the components of an
 *       index key range. this will include the journal on which writes for the
 *       key range are multiplexed with other key ranges on either the same or
 *       other indices, any frozen snapshot of a journal that is being processed
 *       into index segment files, and those index segment files themselves. if
 *       a key range is always mapped (multiplexed) to a process on a host, then
 *       the historical journal snapshots and index key range files can be
 *       managed by the host rather than showing up in the metadata index
 *       directly.
 * 
 * @todo drop the jdbm-based btree implementation in favor of this one.
 * 
 * @todo support column store style indices (key, column, timestamp), locality
 *       groups that partition the key space so that we can fully buffer parts
 *       of the index that matter, automated version history policies that
 *       expire old values based on either an external timestamp or write time
 *       on the server.
 * 
 * @todo support key range iterators that allow concurrent structural
 *       modification. structural mutations in a b+tree are relatively limited.
 *       When prior-next references are available, an iterator should be easily
 *       able to adjust for insertion and removal of keys.
 * 
 * @todo support efficient insert of sorted data (batch or bulk insert).
 * 
 * @todo support efficient conditional inserts, e.g., if this key does not exist
 *       then insert this value.
 * 
 * @todo support key compression (prefix and suffix compression and split
 *       interval trickery).
 * 
 * @todo split cache for nodes and leaves.
 * 
 * @todo evict subranges by touching the node on the way up so that a node that
 *       is evicted from the hard reference cache will span a subrange that can
 *       be evicted together. this will help to preserve locality on disk. with
 *       this approach leaves might be evicted indepdently, but also as part of
 *       a node subrange eviction.
 * 
 * @todo maintain prior-next references among leaves (and nodes?) in memory even
 *       if we are not able to write them onto the disk. when reading in a leaf,
 *       always set the prior/next reference iff the corresponding leaf is in
 *       memory - this is easily handled by checking the weak references on the
 *       parent node.
 * 
 * @todo since forward scans are much more common, change the post-order
 *       iterator for commit processing to use a reverse traversal so that we
 *       can write the next leaf field whenever we evict a sequence of leaves as
 *       part of a sub-range commit.
 * 
 * @todo pre-fetch leaves for range scans? this really does require asynchronous
 *       IO, which is not available for many platforms (it is starting to show
 *       up in linux 2.6 kernals).
 * 
 * @todo refactor object index implementation into two variants providing
 *       isolation. In one the objects are referenced but exist outside of the
 *       index. This is the current design. In the other, then objects are
 *       stored as part of the values in the index. This is a clustered object
 *       index design and is identicaly to the design where non-int64 keys are
 *       used for the index. The latter design requires that we replace the
 *       currentSlots reference with the current version data. The advantage of
 *       this design is two fold. First, the index may be split into multiple
 *       segments and therefore scales out. Second, objects with key locality
 *       have retrieval locality as well. The former design has an advantage iff
 *       the objects are migrated to a read-optimized segment in which the int64
 *       identifier directly addresses the object in a slot on a page. Making
 *       clustering work effectively with the int64 object index by reference
 *       design probably requires mechanisms for assigning persistent
 *       identifiers based on expected locality of reference, e.g., late
 *       assignment of identifiers to persistence capable transient objects or
 *       an explicit notion of clustering rules or "local" objects.
 * 
 * @todo Support periodic rebuilding (for locality rather than packing purposes
 *       since we have packed index nodes in any case). A goal would be to have
 *       both contiguous leaves with prior/next references intack and to have
 *       the index nodes in a known block on disk for efficient loading. Writes
 *       on a rebuilt index would naturally cause locality to degrade until the
 *       index was rebuilt.
 * 
 * @todo Note that efficient support for large branching factors requires a more
 *       sophisticated approach to maintaining the key order within a node or
 *       leaf. E.g., using a red-black tree or adaptive packed memory array.
 *       However, we can use smaller branching factors for btrees in the journal
 *       and use a separate implementation for bulk generating and reading
 *       "perfect" read-only key range segments.
 * 
 * @todo Support bloom filters. Figure out whether they go in front of an index
 *       or just an index range segment.
