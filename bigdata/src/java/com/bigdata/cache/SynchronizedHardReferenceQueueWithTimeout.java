/**
 * <p>
 * Thread-safe version with timeout for clearing stale references from the
 * queue. Clearing of stale entries is accomplished when a value is added to the
 * {@link SynchronizedHardReferenceQueue}. If the value implements the
 * {@link IValueAge} interface, then the tail of the queue is tested and any
 * entry on the tail whose age as reported by that interface exceeds a timeout
 * is evicted. This continues until we reach the first value on the tail of the
 * queue whose age is greater than the timeout. This behavior is enabled if a
 * non-ZERO timeout is specified and then only if the generic type of the
 * objects in the queue extends {@link IValueAge}. Stales references are also
 * cleared by a background thread.
