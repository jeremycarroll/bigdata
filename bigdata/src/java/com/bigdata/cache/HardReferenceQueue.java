/**
 * <p>
 * A cache for hard references using an LRU policy. References are simply
 * cached, but objects are not recoverable from their reference. In order to
 * make an object recoverable, this cache must be wrapped by a weak reference
 * cache that implements a hash map for discovery of objects using their
 * persistent identifier. The {@link HardReferenceQueue} has a capacity that
 * determines the #of hard references that may be cached before an object is
 * evicted from the cache. Objects may be stored multiple times on the cache but
 * the nscan most recent references are always tested before appending a
 * reference to the cache in order to minimize cache churn when an object is
 * touched repeatedly in close succession. Likewise, eviction does not mean that
 * the object is no longer on the hard reference cache, nor does eviction mean
 * that no hard references to the object exist within the VM. However, eviction
 * is nevertheless used to drive persistence of the object. Since an object may
 * be evicted multiple times without being updated in between evictions, this
 * requires the object to implement a protocol for determining whether or not it
 * is dirty. Eviction is then contingent on that protocol and the dirty state of
 * the object is reset when it is serialized for eviction. In combination with
 * the object's dirty protocol, the hard reference cache can substitute for a
 * commit list.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This implementation is NOT synchronized.
