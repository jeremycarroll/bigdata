/**
 * <p>
 * A cache for hard references using an LRU policy. References are simply
 * cached, but objects are not recoverable from their reference. In order to
 * make an object recoverable, this cache must be wrapped by a weak reference
 * cache that implements a hash map for discovery of objects using their
 * persistent identifier. The {@link HardReferenceQueue} has a capacity that
 * determines the #of hard references that may be cached before an object is
 * evicted from the cache. Objects may be stored multiple times on the cache but
 * the nscan most recent references are always tested before appending a
 * reference to the cache in order to minimize cache churn when an object is
 * touched repeatedly in close succession. Likewise, eviction does not mean that
 * the object is no longer on the hard reference cache, nor does eviction mean
 * that no hard references to the object exist within the VM. However, eviction
 * is nevertheless used to drive persistence of the object. Since an object may
 * be evicted multiple times without being updated in between evictions, this
 * requires the object to implement a protocol for determining whether or not it
 * is dirty. Eviction is then contigent on that protocol and the dirty state of
 * the object is reset when it is serialized for eviction. In combination with
 * the object's dirty protocol, the hard reference cache can substitute for a
 * commit list.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clearing of stale entries is accomplished when a value is added to the
 * {@link HardReferenceQueue}. If the value implements the {@link IValueAge}
 * interface, then the tail of the queue is tested and any entry on the tail
 * whose age as reported by that interface exceeds a timeout is evicted. This
 * continues until we reach the first value on the tail of the queue whose age
 * is greater than the timeout. This behavior is enabled if a non-ZERO timeout
 * is specified and then only if the generic type of the objects in the queue
 * extends {@link IValueAge}. Note that old references WILL NOT be cleared
 * until {@link #append(Object)} is invoked. You can force clearing of old
 * references to occur at least periodically using {@link #evictStaleRefs(long)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This implementation is NOT synchronized.
