/**
 * A low-contention/high concurrency weak value cache. This class can offer
 * substantially less lock contention and hence greater performance than the
 * {@link WeakValueCache}.
 * <p>
 * The role of the {@link HardReferenceQueue} is to place a minimum upper bound
 * on the #of objects in the cache. If the application holds hard references to
 * more than this many objects, e.g., in various threads, collections, etc.,
 * then the cache size can be larger than the queue capacity. Likewise, if the
 * JVM takes too long to finalize weakly reachable references, then the cache
 * size can exceed this limit even if the application does not hold ANY hard
 * references to the objects in the cache. For these reasons, this class uses an
 * initialCapacity for the inner {@link ConcurrentHashMap} that is larger than
 * the <i>queueCapacity</i>. This helps to prevent resizing the
 * {@link ConcurrentHashMap} which is a relatively expensive operation.
 * <p>
 * Note: you can set a <i>timeout</i> for the {@link HardReferenceQueue}. This
 * may be used to evict references from the tail of the queue whose last access
 * time exceeds the timeout. The entries for those references WILL NOT be
 * cleared from this map as long as those references remain strongly reachable.
 * You may periodically invoke {@link #clearStaleRefs()} in order to clear
 * references even when the map is not being touched.
