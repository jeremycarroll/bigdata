/**
 * Interface for operations on an ordered set of keys. Each key is a variable
 * length unsigned byte[]. Keys are considered to be <em>immutable</em>, though
 * this is NOT enforced. Several aspects of the code assume that a byte[] key is
 * NOT modified once it has been created. This makes it possible to copy
 * references to keys rather than allocating new byte[]s and copying the data.
 * There are mutable and immutable implementations of this interface.
 * 
 * FIXME (a) the prefix compression form should be serialization only so the
 * {@link ImmutableKeyBuffer} should be deprecated. This will leave
 * {@link MutableKeyBuffer} (copies references) and there should be a
 * CompactingKeyBuffer as well (copies bytes into its buffer, uses a journal
 * style allocator, and compacts when it would overflow).
 * <p>
 * (De-)serialization needs to be decoupled from the choice of how the key
 * buffer gets implemented, so that means that we are not going to be able to
 * read in a raw byte[] and "just" process the record directly. Instead, there
 * needs to be an API for populating the key buffer when it is de-serialized.
 * Since there is no longer an immutable version we can just add(byte[]) or
 * add(byte[],off,len) for each key read from the serialized form - this will
 * let us do dictionary style compression without requiring that we keep the
 * leaf compressed in memory.
 * <p>
 * The only hope in this for a raw record read and processing would be to have
 * the node or leaf state and its keys/children/value state all in the same
 * CompactingBuffer and have an API suitable for partitioning the buffer into
 * some fixed size regions (values that are overwritten when they are replaced)
 * and a variable length region that is used to store keys, values, timestamps,
 * and child addresses and compacted as necessary.
 * <p>
 * Even that is not really a "raw record" since the data are still
 * de-serialized, e.g., undoing dictionary compression or other techniques as
 * applied to keys, values, etc. It is really a technique to reduce the #of
 * distinct references in the heap and to reduce the amount of allocation by
 * copying data into a CompactingBuffer. In this way it is very much like the
 * GOM data record and it might be possible to reuse that as the basis for this.
 * In that case it was more efficient to operate with a long[] than a byte[]. In
 * fact, an int[] might be best for the 32bit generation while a long[] would be
 * better for 64bit machines. For GOM, we have a lot of long values so that
 * long[] had a bit of an edge in that way as well.
