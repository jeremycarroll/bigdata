/**
 * <p>
 * This class implements a variant of a B+Tree in which all values are stored in
 * leaves, but the leaves are not connected with prior-next links. This
 * constraint arises from the requirement to support a copy-on-write policy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: No mechanism is exposed for fetching a node or leaf of the tree other
 * than the root by its key. This is because the parent reference on the node
 * (or leaf) can only be set when it is read from the store in context by its
 * parent node.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: the leaves can not be stitched together with prior and next references
 * without forming cycles that make it impossible to write out the leaves of the
 * btree. This restriction arises because each time we write out a node or leaf
 * it is assigned a persistent identifier as an unavoidable artifact of
 * providing isolation for the object index.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This implementation is thread-safe for concurent readers BUT NOT for
 * concurrent writers. If a writer has access to a {@link BTree} then there MUST
 * NOT be any other reader -or- writer operating on the {@link BTree} at the
 * same time.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @todo consider also tracking the #of deleted entries in a key range (parallel
 *       to how we track the #of entries in a key range) so that we can report
 *       the exact #of non-deleted entries when the btree supports isolation
 *       (right now you have to do a key range scan and count the #of
 *       non-deleted entries).
 * 
 * @todo Choose the split point in the branch nodes within a parameterized
 *       region such that we choose the shortest separator keys to promote to
 *       the parent. This is a bit more tricky for the
 *       {@link IndexSegmentBuilder}.
 * 
 * @todo reuse a buffer when copying keys and values out of the index, e.g., for
 *       the {@link ITupleIterator}, in order to minimize heap churn.
 * 
 * @todo The B+Tree implementation does not support limits on the serialized
 *       size of a node or leaf. The design strategy is to allow flexible sizes
 *       for serialized node and leaf records since larger branching factors and
 *       continuous IO are cheaper and nothing in particular requires the use of
 *       fixed size records when accessing disk. However, it would still be
 *       useful to be able to place an upper bound on the serialized size of a
 *       node or leaf. Nodes and leaves are only serialized on eviction, so this
 *       would require the ability to split nodes and/or leaves immediately
 *       before eviction if they would be likely to overflow the upper bound on
 *       the record size. Probably the node or leaf needs to be made immutable,
 *       the serialized size checked, and then a split operation invoked if the
 *       record would exceed the upper bound. If this happens a lot, then the
 *       branching factor is too high for the data and would have to be lowered
 *       to regain performance.
 *       <p>
 *       Another use case for limits on the size of a node/leaf is maintaining
 *       the data in a serialized form. This can have several benefits,
 *       including reducing heap churn by copying keys and values (not their
 *       references) into the record structure, and reducing (eliminating)
 *       deserialization costs (which are substantially more expensive than
 *       serialization). This can be approached using new implementations of the
 *       key buffer and a value buffer implementation (one that can be used for
 *       nodes or for leaves). If an object implements both then it is a small
 *       additional step towards using it for the entire serialized record
 *       (minus some header/tailer).
 *       <p>
 *       Adaptive packed memory arrays can be used in this context to minimize
 *       the amount of copying that needs to be performed on mutation of a node
 *       or leaf.
 *       <p>
 *       Leading key compression is intrinsically part of how the key buffer
 *       maintains its representation so, for example, a micro-index would have
 *       to be maintained as part of the key buffer.
 * 
 * @todo create ring buffers to track the serialized size of the last 50 nodes
 *       and leaves so that we can estimate the serialized size of the total
 *       btree based on recent activity. we could use a moving average and
 *       persist it as part of the btree metadata. this could be used when
 *       making a decision to evict a btree vs migrate it onto a new journal and
 *       whether to split or join index segments during a journal overflow
 *       event.
 * 
 * @todo we could defer splits by redistributing keys to left/right siblings
 *       that are under capacity - this makes the tree a b*-tree. however, this
 *       is not critical since the journal is designed to be fully buffered and
 *       the index segments are read-only but it would reduce memory by reducing
 *       the #of nodes -- and we can expect that the siblings will be either
 *       resident or in the direct buffer for the journal
 * 
 * @todo evict subranges by touching the node on the way up so that a node that
 *       is evicted from the hard reference cache will span a subrange that can
 *       be evicted together. this will help to preserve locality on disk. with
 *       this approach leaves might be evicted independently, but also as part
 *       of a node subrange eviction.
 * 
 * @todo since forward scans are much more common, change the post-order
 *       iterator for commit processing to use a reverse traversal so that we
 *       can write the next leaf field whenever we evict a sequence of leaves as
 *       part of a sub-range commit (probably not much of an issue since the
 *       journal is normally fully buffered and the perfect index segments will
 *       not have this problem).
 * 
 * @todo pre-fetch leaves for range scans? if we define a parallel iterator
 *       flag?
 * 
 * @todo Note that efficient support for large branching factors requires a more
 *       sophisticated approach to maintaining the key order within a node or
 *       leaf. E.g., using a red-black tree or adaptive packed memory array.
 *       However, we can use smaller branching factors for btrees in the journal
 *       and use a separate implementation for bulk generating and reading
 *       "perfect" read-only key range segments.
 * 
 * @todo derive a string index that uses patricia trees in the leaves per
 *       several published papers.

         * A stack containing the ordered ancestors of the current leaf. The
         * root of the B+Tree will always be on the bottom of the stack. Nodes
         * are pushed onto the stack during top-down navigation by the various
         * methods that (re-)locate the current leaf.
         * <p>
         * The purpose of this stack is to ensure that the ancestors of the
         * current leaf remain strongly reachable while the cursor is positioned
         * on that leaf. This is necessary in order for the methods that change
         * the cursor position {@link #next()} {@link #prior()} to succeeed
         * since they depend on the parent references which could otherwise be
         * cleared (parent references of nodes and leaves are weak references).
         * This means that hard references MUST be held to all {@link Node}s
         * that are ancestors of the current {@link Leaf}. This criteria is
         * satisfied by normal top-down navigation since the hard references are
         * on the stack frame. However, non-recursive constructions violate this
         * requirement since the hard references to the parents are not on the
         * stack frame. This {@link Stack} of {@link Node}s is therefore
         * maintained by all of the methods on this class such that we always
         * have hard references for the ancestors of the leaf that is being
         * visited.
         * <p>
         * Another benefit of this stack is that is ensures that not only the
         * current leaf but also all nodes above the current leaf remain
         * strongly reachable and hence require NO IOs. This should have the
         * most pronounced effect on a read-only {@link BTree} with a large
         * number of concurrent cursors as the hard reference queue for the
         * index might otherwise let the relevant nodes become weakly reachable.
         * It will have less of a performance effect for a mutable {@link BTree}
         * since that class is single-threaded for writers.
         * <p>
         * Note: The {@link IndexSegment} handles this differently since it has
         * the address of the prior and next leaf on hand and does not need the
         * parent references for navigation.
