/**
 * <p>
 * A view onto an unisolated index partition which enforces the constraint that
 * either concurrent writers -or- a single writer may have access to the
 * unisolated index at any given time. This provides the maximum possible
 * concurrency for an unisolated index using an internal {@link ReadWriteLock}
 * to coordinate threads.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The possible concurrency with this approach is higher than that provided by
 * the {@link IConcurrencyManager} since the latter only allows a single process
 * access to the unisolated index while this class can allow multiple readers
 * concurrent access to the same unisolated index. <strong>The use of this class
 * is NOT compatible with the {@link IConcurrencyManager}</strong> (the
 * {@link IConcurrencyManager} does not respect the locks managed by this
 * class).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class does NOT handle deadlock detection. However, it does not expose
 * the underlying lock and the scope of the acquired lock should always be
 * restricted to a single operation as defined by {@link IIndex}. If you
 * circumvent this by writing and submitting an {@link IIndexProcedure} that
 * attempts an operation on another {@link UnisolatedReadWriteIndex} then a
 * deadlock MAY occur.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The point test methods on this class (get, contains, lookup, remove) have
 * relatively high overhead since they need to acquire and release the lock per
 * point test. If you need to do a bunch of point tests, then submit an
 * {@link IIndexProcedure} that will run against the underlying index once it
 * has acquired the appropriate lock -- point tests from within the
 * {@link IIndexProcedure} will be very efficient.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Design notes</h2>
 * 
 * This class was developed to squeeze the maximum possible performance out of a
 * local database. The use of this class can provide correct interleaving of
 * readers and writers without the use of the {@link ConcurrencyManager} and the
 * group commit protocol which it imposes on writers. It also facilitates the
 * reuse of the buffers backing the unisolated index, which can reduce IO
 * associated with index operations when compared to reading on a read-committed
 * view of the index with concurrent writes and interleaved commits on the
 * corresponding unisolated index.
 * <p>
 * Reading on the read-committed index view has greater possible concurrency,
 * but requires that writes are committed before they become visible and must
 * read the data from the disk since it does not have access to the buffers for
 * the unisolated index. Requiring a commit in order for the writes to become
 * visible imposes significant latency, especially when computing the fix point
 * of a rule set which may take multiple rounds. Reading on the unisolated index
 * should do better in terms of buffer reuse and does NOT require commits or
 * checkpoints of the index for writes to become visible to readers but does
 * require a means to correctly interleave access to the unisolated index, which
 * is the purpose of this class.
 * <p>
 * While the {@link LockManager} could be modified to support Share vs Exclusive
 * locks and to use Share locks for readers and Exclusive locks for writers,
 * writers would still block until the next commit so the throughput (e.g., when
 * computing the fix point of a rule set) is significantly lower.
 *
