/**
 * <p>
 * Implementation that uses the ICU library (which supports compressed sort
 * keys).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class uses <a href="http://icu.sourceforge.net">ICU4J</a>. There are
 * several advantages to the ICU libraries: (1) the collation keys are
 * compressed; (2) the libraries are faster than the jdk classes; (3) the
 * libraries support Unicode 5; and (4) the libraries have the same behavior
 * under Java and C/C++ so you can have interoperable code. There is also JNI
 * (Java Native Interface) implementation for many platforms for even greater
 * performance and compatibility.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: The sort keys generated by the ICU libraries critically depend on the
 * {@link Locale} and MAY be different depending on the software version of the
 * ICU libraries. ICU makes available a version number that is changed each time
 * a software revision would result in a change in the generated sort order.
 * Futher note that the sort keys generated by the ICU libraries are NOT
 * compatible with those generated by the JDK {@link java.text.Collator}
 * classes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This is a top-level class in order to avoid runtime dependencies on the
 * ICU libraries when they are not required.
 * </p>
 * 
 * FIXME verify runtime with ICU4JNI, optimize generation of collation keys ( by
 * using lower level iterators over the collation groups), and make sure that
 * the code will run against both the ICU4JNI and ICU4J interfaces.
 * 
 * FIXME there appears to be an issue between ICU4JNI and jrockit under win xp
 * professional. try the icu4jni 3.6.1 patch (done, but does not fix the
 * problem) and ask on the mailing list.
 * 
 * FIXME TestAvailableCharsets Charset.availableCharsets() returned a number
 * less than the number returned by icu -- is this a serious error? - it
 * prevents the test suite from completing correctly. check on the mailing list.
 * 
 * @todo try out the ICU boyer-moore search implementation and see if it is
 *       defined for sort keys (more generally, for unsigned byte[]s) not just
 *       char[]s.
 * 
 * @see http://icu.sourceforge.net
