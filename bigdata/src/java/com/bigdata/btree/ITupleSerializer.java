/**
 * An interface that provides for the (de)-serialization of the value of a tuple
 * stored in an index and, when possible, the key under which that value is
 * stored.
 * <p>
 * The encoded key is always a variable length unsigned byte[]s. The purpose of
 * the encoded key is to determine the total order over the tuple in the B+Tree.
 * While some key encodings are reversable without less (e.g., int, long, float
 * or double), many key encodings are simply not decodable (including Unicode
 * keys). Applications that require the ability to decode complex keys may need
 * to resort to storing the unencoded key state redundently in the tuple value.
 * 
 * FIXME extSer integration. There are two broad setups. (1) Local: when running
 * without an {@link IMetadataService} and hence on a single
 * {@link AbstractJournal}, the serializer state should be stored in a record
 * whose address is available from the {@link CommitRecordIndex} of the
 * {@link Journal}. (2) Distributed: when running a distributed federation the
 * serializer state should be stored globally so that the serialized values can
 * be consistently interpreted as they are moved from {@link BTree} to
 * {@link IndexSegment} and from {@link IndexSegment} to {@link IndexSegment}.
 * <p>
 * I am inclined to store the serializer state for the distributed federation on
 * a per-scale-out index basis. This means that you must de-serialize the keys
 * and values in order to copy tuples from one scale-out index to another.
 * However, when copying tuples from one federation to another de-serialization
 * and re-serialization will be required regardless since the serializer state
 * will not be shared and, in fact, could be different for the two indices (this
 * is also true within a single federation or even within a scale-up instance).
 * (There should probably be a utility class to do index copies that handles
 * these various cases).
 * <p>
 * The critical point is being able to recover the reference to the (potentially
 * remote) extSer object from within both the {@link AbstractBTree} and the
 * various {@link ITupleIterator} implementations, including the
 * {@link AbstractChunkedRangeIterator}. Further, the recovered object must
 * cache the extSer state, must have a resonable life cycle so that it is
 * efficient, and must be linked into the commit protocol such that assigned
 * class identifiers are always made persistent if a commit could have included
 * data written using those class identifiers.
