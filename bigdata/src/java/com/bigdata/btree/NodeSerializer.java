/**
 * <p>
 * An instance of this class is used to serialize and de-serialize the
 * {@link INodeData}s and {@link ILeafData}s of an {@link AbstractBTree}. Leaf
 * and non-leaf records have different serialization formats, but their leading
 * bytes use the same format so that you can tell by inspection whether a buffer
 * contains a leaf or a non-leaf node. The header of the record uses a fixed
 * length format so that some fields can be tested without full
 * de-serialization, especially whether the record contains a leaf vs a node.
 * This fixed record also makes it possible to update some fields in the header
 * once the entire record has been serialized, including the checksum, the #of
 * bytes in the serialized record, and the prior/next addresses for leaves.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The methods defined by this class all work with {@link ByteBuffer}s. On read,
 * the buffer must be positioned to the start of the data to be read. After a
 * read, the buffer will be positioned to the first byte after the data read. If
 * there is insufficient data available in the buffer then an
 * {@link BufferUnderflowException} will be thrown. On write, the data will be
 * written on an internal buffer whose size is automatically extended. The write
 * buffer is reused for each write and quickly achieves a maximum size for any
 * given {@link BTree}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link IDataSerializer}s for the keys and the values hide the use of
 * {@link ByteBuffer}s from the application. The use of compression or packing
 * techniques within the implementations of this interface is encouraged.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: while the {@link NodeSerializer} is NOT thread-safe for writers, it is
 * thread-safe for readers. This design mirrors the concurrency capabilities of
 * the {@link AbstractBTree}.
 * </p>
