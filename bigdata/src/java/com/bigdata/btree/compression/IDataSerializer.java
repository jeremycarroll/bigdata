/**
 * Interface for custom serialization of logical <code>byte[][]</code> data
 * such are used to represent keys or values. Some implementations work equally
 * well for both (e.g., no compression, huffman compression, dictionary
 * compression) while others can require that the data are fully ordered (e.g.,
 * hu-tucker compression which only works for keys).
 * <p>
 * Note: there are a few odd twists to this API. It is designed to be used both
 * for the keys and values in the {@link AbstractBTree} and for the keys and
 * values in {@link IKeyArrayIndexProcedure}s, which are auto-split against the
 * index partitions and hence use a {fromIndex, toIndex}. This leads to the
 * requirement that the caller allocate the {@link IMutableRandomAccessByteArray} into
 * which the data will be de-serialized so that they can specify the capacity of
 * that object.
 * <p>
 * The standard practice is to write out <code>toIndex</code> as (toIndex -
 * fromIndex), which is the #of keys to be written. When the data are read back
 * in the fromIndex is assumed to be zero and toIndex will be the #of elements
 * to read. This has the effect of making the array compact. Likewise, when
 * <code>deserializedSize == 0</code> the size of the array to be allocated on
 * deserialization is normally computed as <code>toIndex - fromIndex</code> so
 * that the resulting array will be compact on deserialization. A non-zero value
 * is specified by the {@link NodeSerializer} so that the array is correctly
 * dimensioned for the branching factor of the {@link AbstractBTree} when it is
 * de-serialized.
 * <p>
 * Note: When the {@link IDataSerializer} will be used for values stored in an
 * {@link AbstractBTree} then it MUST handle [null] elements. The B+Tree both
 * allows <code>null</code>s and the {@link MutableKeyBuffer} will report a
 * <code>null</code> when the corresponding index entry is deleted (in an
 * index that supports deletion markers).
 * 
 * FIXME Verify that RMI serialization is heavily buffered since we are NOT
 * buffering the {@link OutputBitStream} and {@link InputBitStream} objects in
 * order to minimize heap churn and since we have the expectation that they are
 * writing/reading on buffered streams.
 * 
 * @todo support compression (hu-tucker, huffman, delta-coding of keys,
 *       application defined compression, etc.)
 *       <p>
 *       user-defined tokenization into symbols (hu-tucker, huffman)
 * 
 * @todo test suites for each of the {@link IDataSerializer}s, including when
 *       the reference is a null byte[][], when it has zero length, and when
 *       there are null elements in the byte[][].
 * 
 * @todo could use hamming codes for bytes.
 * 
 * @todo variants for custom parsing into symbols for hamming codes.
 * 
 * @todo use a delta from key to key specifying how much to be reused - works
 *       well if deserializing keys or for a linear key scan, but not for binary
 *       search on the raw node/leaf record.
 * 
 * @todo verify that keys are monotonic during constructor from mutable keys and
 *       during de-serialization.
 * 
 * @todo add nkeys to the abstract base class and keep a final (read-only) copy
 *       on this class. if the value in the base class is changed then it is an
 *       error but this allows direct access to the field in the base class for
 *       the mutable key buffer implementation.
 * 
 * @todo even more compact serialization of sorted byte[]s is doubtless
 *       possible, perhaps as a patricia tree, trie, or other recursive
 *       decomposition of the prefixes. figure out what decomposition is the
 *       most compact, easy to compute from sorted byte[]s, and supports fast
 *       search on the keys to identify the corresponding values.
