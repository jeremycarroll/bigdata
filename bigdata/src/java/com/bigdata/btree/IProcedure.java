/**

 * communicating state to the {@link IDataService}. If an instance of this
 * procedure will cross a network interface, then the implementation Class MUST
 * be available to the {@link IDataService} on which it will execute. This can
 * be as simple as bundling the procedure into a JAR that is part of the
 * CLASSPATH used to start a {@link DataService} or you can use downloaded code
 * with the JINI codebase mechanism (<code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code>).
 * <p>
 * Note: While we could define a "procedure" operation on multiple named
 * indices, clients of the {@link IDataService} API would be unable to exploit
 * that operation without unreasonable knowledge of the location of index
 * partitions throughout the federation. People requiring those semantics who
 * are operating against an embedded {@link Journal} can trivially realize them
 * by extending {@link AbstractTask}.
