/**
 * <p>
 * The persistent and mostly immutable metadata for a {@link AbstractBTree}.
 * This class allows you to configured several very important aspects of the
 * B+Tree behavior. Read on.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An instance of this class is required in order to create a {@link BTree} or
 * {@link IndexSegment}. Further, when registering a scale-out index you will
 * first create an instance of this class that will serve as the metadata
 * <i>template</i> for all index resources which are part of that scale-out
 * index.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Delete markers, version timestamps, and isolatable indices</h2>
 * <p>
 * By default a {@link BTree} does not maintain delete markers and a request to
 * delete an entry under a key will cause that entry to be removed from the live
 * version of the index. However, such indices do not support "overflow" (they
 * can not be evicted onto read-only {@link IndexSegment}s) and as such they do
 * not support scale-out).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link SparseRowStore} handles a "delete" of a property value by writing
 * a <code>null</code> value under a key and does NOT require the use of index
 * entry delete markers, even in scale-out deployments. A compacting merge of a
 * {@link SparseRowStore} applies a history policy based on a consideration of
 * the timestamped property values, including values bound to a
 * <code>null</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Delete markers combined with an ordered set of index resources is sufficient
 * to support all features of range-partitioned indices, including compacting
 * merge. Given three index resources {A,B,C} for a single index partition, the
 * order over the resources gives us the guarentee that any index entry in A
 * will be more recent than any index enty in B or C. So when reading a fused
 * view we always stop once we have an index entry for a key, even if that entry
 * has the deleted flag set.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Delete markers occupy very little space in the leaf data structure (one bit
 * each), however when they are used a deleted index entry is NOT removed from
 * the index. Instead, the key remains in the leaf paired to a delete bit and a
 * <code>null</code> value (or simply elided). These "deleted" entries can
 * only be removed from the index by a compacting merge. When transactional
 * isolation is used, the criteria for removing deleted entries are stronger -
 * they must no longer be visible to any active or allowable transaction as
 * determined by the transaction manager, see below for more on this.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Transaction isolation requires delete markers <i>plus</i> version
 * timestamps. The version timestamps in the unisolated index (the live index)
 * give the timestamp of the commit during which the index entry was last
 * updated. The timestamp in the write set of transaction is copy from the index
 * view corresponding to the ground state of the transaction the first time that
 * index entry is overwritten within that transaction (there is a special case
 * when the index entry was not pre-existing - we assign the start time of the
 * transaction in that case so when we validate we are only concerned that the
 * entry is either not found (never written) or that the entry exists with the
 * same timestamp - other conditions are write-write conflicts). On commit we
 * write the commit time on the updated index entries in the unisolated index.
 * </p>
 * <h2>History policies and timestamps</h2>
 * <p>
 * There are in fact two kinds of timestamps in use - isolatable indices place a
 * timestamp on the index entry itself while the {@link SparseRowStore} places a
 * timestamp in the <i>key</i>. One consequence of this is that it is very
 * efficient to read historical data from the {@link SparseRowStore} since the
 * data are right there in key order. On the other hand, reading historical data
 * from an isolatable index requires reading from each historical commit state
 * of that index which is not interest (this is NOT efficient). This is why the
 * {@link SparseRowStore} design places timestamps in the key - so that the
 * application can efficiently read both the current and historical property
 * values within a logical row.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Regardless of whether the timestamp is on the index entry (as it always is
 * for isolatable indices) or in the key ({@link SparseRowStore}), the
 * existence of timestamps makes it possible for an application to specify a
 * history policy governing when property values will be deleted.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When an index participates in transactions the transaction manager manages
 * the life cycle of overwritten and deleted index entries (and the resources on
 * which the indices exist). This is done by preserving such data until no
 * transaction exists that can read from those resources. Unless an immortal
 * store is desired, the "purge time" is set at a time no more recent than the
 * earliest fully isolated transaction (either a read-only tx as of the start
 * time of the tx or a read-write tx as of its start time). The role of a
 * "history policy" with transactions is therefore how much history to buffer
 * between the earliest running tx and the choosen "purge time". When the
 * transaction manager updates the "purge time" it notifies the journal/data
 * services. Resources having no data later than the purge time may be deleted
 * and SHOULD NOT be carried forward when building new index segments.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * History policies for non-transactional indices are somewhat different. An
 * scale-out index without timestamps will buffer historical data only until the
 * next compacting merge of a given index partition. The compacting merge uses
 * the fused view of the resources comprising the index partition and only
 * writes out the undeleted index entries.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If an application instead chooses to use timestamps in a non-transactional
 * index then (a) timestamps must be assigned by either the client or the data
 * service; and (b) applications can specify a history policy where data older
 * than a threshold time (but not #of versions) will be eradicated. This
 * approach is possible, but not well-supported in the higher level APIs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link SparseRowStore} design is more flexible since it allows (a) fast
 * access to historical property values for the same "row"; and (b) history
 * policies that may be specified in terms of the #of versions, the age of a
 * datum, and that can keep at least N versions of a datum. This last point is
 * quite important as it allows you to retain the entirety of the most current
 * revision of the logical row, even when some datums are much older than
 * others.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Serialization</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note: Derived classes SHOULD extend the {@link Externalizable} interface and
 * explicitly manage serialization versions so that their metadata may evolve in
 * a backward compatible manner.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @todo Introduce the various methods for finding split points (or refining /
 *       rejecting them), for handling overflow extensions (such as copying raw
 *       records from the journal to the image segment (bigdatarepository) and
 *       keeping them in play through successive overflows, history policy,
 *       etc).
 * 
 * @todo Consider just having a property set since there are so many possible
 *       properties.
 * 
 * @todo Write (de-)serialization tests for both kinds of metadata including
 *       with the optional metadata (pmd, etc).
 * 
 * @todo Make sure that metadata for index partition "zones" propagates with the
 *       partition metadata so that appropriate policies are enforcable locally
 *       (access control, latency requirements, replication, purging of
 *       historical deleted versions, etc).
