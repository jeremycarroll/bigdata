/**
 * Interface for sequential and random-access cursor-based {@link ITuple}
 * operations on an index or index partition. The interface extends the standard
 * {@link Iterator} for forward sequential scans and also provides symmetric
 * methods for reverse sequential scans using {@link #hasPrior()} and
 * {@link #prior()}. Random access is supported using {@link #seek(byte[])}.
 * When {@link #first()}, {@link #last()}, or {@link #seek(byte[])} return
 * <code>null</code> this is an indication that there is no visitable tuple in
 * the index corresponding to that request. Likewise {@link #tuple()} will
 * return <code>null</code> if the cursor position does not correspond to a
 * tuple in the index or if the tuple at that cursor position has since been
 * deleted.
 * <p>
 * Note: Normally {@link ITupleCursor}s are provisioned such that deleted
 * tuples are not visited (they are skipped over if delete markers are used by
 * the index). This corresponds to the most common application requirement.
 * However, cursors MAY be provisioned using {@link IRangeQuery#DELETED} to
 * visit deleted tuples for indices that maintain delete markers.
