     *            The #of tuples that are being inserted(in).
     * @param keys
     *            A series of keys paired to values (in). Each key is an
     *            variable length unsigned byte[]. The keys must be presented in
     *            sorted order in order to obtain maximum efficiency for the
     *            batch operation.<br>
     *            The individual byte[] keys provided to this method MUST be
     *            immutable - if the content of a given byte[] in <i>keys</i>
     *            is changed after the method is invoked then the change MAY
     *            have a side-effect on the keys stored in leaves of the tree.
     *            While this constraint applies to the individual byte[] keys,
     *            the <i>keys</i> byte[][] itself may be reused from invocation
     *            to invocation without side-effect.
     * @param values
     *            Values (one element per key) (in/out). Null elements are
     *            allowed. On output, each element is either null (if there was
     *            no entry for that key) or the old value stored under that key
     *            (which may be null).
