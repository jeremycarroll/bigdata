 * A fused view providing read-write operations on multiple B+-Trees mapping
 * variable length unsigned byte[] keys to arbitrary values. The sources MUST
 * support deletion markers. The order of the sources MUST correspond to the
 * recency of their data. Writes will be directed to the first source in the
 * sequence (the most recent source). Deletion markers are used to prevent a
 * miss on a key for a source from reading through to an older source. If a
 * deletion marker is encoutered the index entry will be understood as "not
 * found" in the fused view rather than reading through to an older source where
 * it might still have a binding.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @todo consider implementing {@link ILocalBTree} here and collapsing
 *       {@link ILocalBTreeView} and {@link ILocalBTree}.
