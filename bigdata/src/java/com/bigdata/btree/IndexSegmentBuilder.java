/**
 * Builds an {@link IndexSegment} given a source btree and a target branching
 * factor. There are two main use cases:
 * <ol>
 * 
 * <li>Evicting a key range of an index into an optimized on-disk index. In
 * this case, the input is a {@link BTree} that is ideally backed by a fully
 * buffered {@link IRawStore} so that no random reads are required.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Merging index segments. In this case, the input is typically records
 * emerging from a merge-sort. There are two distinct cases here. In one, we
 * simply have raw records that are being merged into an index. This might occur
 * when merging two key ranges or when external data are being loaded. In the
 * other case we are processing two timestamped versions of an overlapping key
 * range. In this case, the more recent version may have "delete" markers
 * indicating that a key present in an older version has been deleted in the
 * newer version. Also, key-value entries in the newer version replaced (rather
 * than are merged with) key-value entries in the older version. If an entry
 * history policy is defined, then it must be applied here to cause key-value
 * whose retention is no longer required by that policy to be dropped.</li>
 * 
 * </ol>
 * 
 * Note: In order for the nodes to be written in a contiguous block we either
 * have to buffer them in memory or have to write them onto a temporary file and
 * then copy them into place after the last leaf has been processed. The code
 * abstracts this decision using a {@link TemporaryRawStore} for this purpose.
 * This space demand was not present in West's algorithm because it did not
 * attempt to place the leaves contiguously onto the store.

 * @see "Post-order B-Tree Construction" by Lawerence West, ACM 1992. Note that
 *      West's algorithm is for a b-tree (values are stored on internal stack as
 *      well as leaves), not a b+-tree (values are stored only on the leaves).
 *      Our implementation is therefore an adaptation.
 * 
 * @see "Batch-Construction of B+-Trees" by Kim and Won, ACM 2001. The approach
 *      outlined by Kim and Won is designed for B+-Trees, but it appears to be
 *      less efficient on first glance.

 * FIXME support efficient prior/next leaf scans (nextAddr and modify the itr to
