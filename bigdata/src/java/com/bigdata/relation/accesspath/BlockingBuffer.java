 * <p>
 * A buffer that will block when it is full. You write elements on the buffer

 * concurrent writes (multiple threads can use {@link #add(Object)}) but the
 * {@link #iterator()} is not thread-safe (it assumes a single reader).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>You MUST make sure that the thread that sets up the
 * {@link BlockingBuffer} and which submits a task that writes on the buffer
 * also sets the {@link Future} on the {@link BlockingBuffer} so that the
 * iterator can monitor the {@link Future}, detect if it has been cancelled,
 * and throw out the exception from the {@link Future} back to the client.
 * Failure to do this can lead to the iterator not terminating!</strong>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: {@link BlockingBuffer} is used (a) for {@link IAccessPath} iterators
 * that exceed the fully-buffered read threashold; (b) for high-level query with
 * at least one join; (c) by the BigdataStatementIteratorImpl, which is used by
 * the RDF DB for high-level query with no joins; and by the
 * BigdataSolutionResolverator, which is used by the RDF DB high-level query
