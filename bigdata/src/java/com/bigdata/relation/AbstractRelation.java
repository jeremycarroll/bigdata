     * @todo Lock service supporting shared locks, leases and lease renewal,

     *       and possibly a resource hierarchy. Leases should be Callable
     *       objects that are submitted by the client to its executor service so
     *       that they will renew automatically until cancelled (and will cancel
     *       automatically if not renewed).
     *       <P>
     *       There is existing code that could be adapted for this purpose. It
     *       might have to be adapted to support lock escalation (shared to
     *       exclusive), a resource hierarchy, and a delay queue to cancel
     *       leases that are not renewed. It would have to be wrapped up as a
     *       low-latency service and made available via the
     *       {@link IBigdataFederation}. It also needs to use a weak reference
     *       cache for the collection of resource queues so that they are GC'd
     *       rather than growing as new resources are locked and never
     *       shrinking.
     *       <p>
     *       If we require pre-declaration of locks, then we do not need the
     *       dependency graph since deadlocks can only arise with 2PL.
     *       <p>
     *       Since the service is remote it should use {@link UUID}s to
     *       identify the lock owner(s).
     *       <p>
     *       The lock service would be used to bracket operations such as
     *       relation {@link #create()} and {@link #destroy()} and would be used
     *       to prevent those operations while a lease is held by concurrent
     *       processes with a shared lock.
     *       <p>
     *       Add ctor flag to create iff not found?
     *       <p>
     *       There needs to be a lock protocol for subclasses so that they can
     *       ensure that they are the only task running create (across the
     *       federation) and so that they can release the lock when they are
     *       done. The lock can be per the notes above, but the protocol with
     *       the subclass will require some coordinating methods.
