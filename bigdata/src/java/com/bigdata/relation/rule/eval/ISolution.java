 * A solution bundles together the materialized element corresponding to the
 * bindings on the head of an {@link IRule} with the {@link IBindingSet} used to
 * generate that solution. For efficiency, the {@link IBindingSet} is often not
 * included. This is an {@link IProgram} option.
 * <p>
 * Note: One use for the {@link IBindingSet}s is to materialize the
 * justifications for the entailments. The RDF DB uses this for to maintain a
 * justifications index in support of truth maintenance.
 * 
 * FIXME It may be easier to always clone and materalize the binding set rather
 * than the element and let the client extract what they want, but we still want
 * the rule available as metadata in either case.
 * 
 * FIXME JOINs need to share some bindings with sub-JOINS, but not the full
 * binding set. Consider this when attending to efficient serialization. Will
 * there be a JOIN operation on the data service itself?
