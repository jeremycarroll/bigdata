/**
 * Task for executing a program when all of the indices for the relation are
 * co-located on the same {@link DataService}.
 * 
 * @todo Named result sets. This would provide a means to run a IRuleTask and
 *       cache the output for further evaluation as a named result set. The
 *       backing store should be a temporary resource. for scale-out it needs to
 *       be visible to the federation (since the rule executing against that
 *       data may be distributed across the federation based on the access path
 *       for the SPORelation) so it would have to be registered on some data
 *       service (any) in the federation and dropped in a finally {} clause.
 *       <p>
 *       When the sets are large then they may need a backing store, e.g.,
 *       BigdataSet<Long> (specialized so that it does not store anything under
 *       the key since we can decode the Long from the key - do utility versions
 *       BigdataLongSet(), but the same code can serve float, double, and int as
 *       well. Avoid override for duplicate keys to reduce IO.
 * 
 * @todo performance comparisons with the old rule execution logic.
 * 
 * @todo it should be possible to have a different action associated with each
 *       rule in the program, and to have a different target relation for the
 *       head of each rule on which we will write (mutation). Different query or
 *       mutation count results could be handled by an extension with
 *       "nextResultSet" style semantics. However, for now, all rules MUST write
 *       on the same buffer. Query results will therefore be multiplexed as will
 *       mutations counts.
 * 
 * @todo it should be possible to handle different relation classes in the same
 *       rules, e.g., RDF and non-RDF relations. Or even the SPO and lexicon
 *       relation for the RDF DB -- the latter will be useful for materializing
 *       extenalized statements efficiently.
 * 
 * @todo could make the return type a generic for {@link AbstractStepTask} and
 *       make this class a concrete implementation of that one.
