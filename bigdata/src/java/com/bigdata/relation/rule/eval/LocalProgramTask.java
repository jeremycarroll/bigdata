/**
 * Task for executing a program when all of the indices for the relation are
 * co-located on the same {@link DataService}.
 * 
 * @todo Named result sets. This would provide a means to run a IRuleTask and
 *       cache the output for further evaluation as a named result set. The
 *       backing store should be a temporary resource. for scale-out it needs to
 *       be visible to the federation (since the rule executing against that
 *       data may be distributed across the federation based on the access path
 *       for the SPORelation) so it would have to be registered on some data
 *       service (any) in the federation and dropped in a finally {} clause.
 *       <p>
 *       When the sets are large then they may need a backing store, e.g.,
 *       BigdataSet<Long> (specialized so that it does not store anything under
 *       the key since we can decode the Long from the key - do utility versions
 *       BigdataLongSet(), but the same code can serve float, double, and int as
 *       well. Avoid override for duplicate keys to reduce IO.
 * 
 * @todo performance comparisons with the old rule execution logic.
 * 
 * @todo it should be possible to have a different action associated with each
 *       rule in the program, and to have a different target relation for the
 *       head of each rule on which we will write (mutation). Different query or
 *       mutation count results could be handled by an extension with
 *       "nextResultSet" style semantics. However, for now, all rules MUST write
 *       on the same buffer. Query results will therefore be multiplexed as will
 *       mutations counts.
 * 
 * @todo it should be possible to handle different relation classes in the same
 *       rules, e.g., RDF and non-RDF relations. Or even the SPO and lexicon
 *       relation for the RDF DB -- the latter will be useful for materializing
 *       extenalized statements efficiently.
 * 
 * @todo could make the return type a generic for {@link AbstractStepTask} and
 *       make this class a concrete implementation of that one.

     * mutations were made to the relation during the round. The design does NOT
     * rely on the relation count before and after the round since it would have
     * to use an _exact_ range count for the relation (otherwise it is possible
     * that a deleted tuple would be overwritten by a computed entailment but
     * that the count would not change). However, the exact range count is
     * relatively expensive which is why the design insists on getting back the
     * #of elements actually written on the index from each rule in each round.
     * If no rules in a given round caused an element to be written, then we are
     * at the fixed point.
     * <p>
     * Note: This assumes that you are following the {@link IMutableRelation}
     * contract -- you MUST NOT overwriting tuples with the same key and value,
     * or at least you must not report such "do nothing" overwrites in the
     * mutation count!!!

     * @todo While there is nothing place to detect {@link IProgram} whose

     *       {@link IStepTask} or added expressivity to produce an

     *       always cancel the {@link Future} or submit it with a timeout.

             * The class relation of relation depends on the class of the

             * temporary relation for each distinct relation for the heads of
             * the rule.
             * 
             * The temporary relation only requires a single index, which ever
             * is most efficient, since it only needs to enforce distinct.
             * 
             * The temporary relation(s) are dropped when the iterator is
             * closed.
             * 
             * The temporary relation(s) can be backed by a TemporaryRawStore
             * for local execution. For distributed execution there will have to
             * be remote access for writing on that temporary relation, so it
             * could be a scale-out index or the data service can be generalized
             * to expose indices on temporary stores. Regardless, writes on the
             * temporary relations need to be buffered and go through the
             * IMutableRelation interface for the relation.
             *

             * also handling additional wrinkles such as mapping the rules over
             * the temporary store and the database. What it is not doing as
             * well is generalizing the notion of a temporary relation into the
             * basic program execution support. However, the caller does have
             * more control over the life cycle of that temporary relation and
             * that additional control is probably necessary if we are
             * interested in more than just a single iterator pass over the
             * temporary relation.
