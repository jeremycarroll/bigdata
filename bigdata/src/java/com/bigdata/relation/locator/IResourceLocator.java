/**
 * An object that knows how to resolve an {@link IResourceIdentifier} to an
 * {@link ILocatableResource} instance. "Locating" a relation means (a)
 * resolving the identifier for the resource and (b) materializing (often from
 * cache) an {@link ILocatableResource} for that resource. Locatable resources
 * are essentially containers for indices, including an {@link IRelation} and an
 * {@link IDatabase}, which is essentially a container for {@link IRelation}s.
 * <p>
 * Note: a locator does not proxy for a resource. Either the resource is locally
 * accessible, including the case of a resource distributed across a federation,
 * or it is not since the resource is accessible using the
 * {@link IBigdataFederation}'s API. However, you CAN NOT "locate" a
 * <em>local</em> resource on another JVM or machine using this interface.
