/**
 * Object manager.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo The largest question facing an unisolated object manager is its
 *       behavior in a distributed database with other concurrent unisolated
 *       object managers and with concurrent transactions. There are also
 *       unresolved questions in concurrency control simply within the journal,
 *       which implements MVCC. I need a better distinction here between what is
 *       possible and what is useful.
 * 
 * @todo Support named objects with transactional isolation. The notional design
 *       uses a B+Tree behind the scenes. The root of the btree is stored in a
 *       known location, e.g., the root block of segment0. There can also be
 *       segment local names. An embedded database would provide only global
 *       names, and they would be implemented as segment local names. Changes to
 *       the tree need to be validated. Other than having to store its root in a
 *       special slot, the tree can use the normal object api and the standard
 *       btree (vs the specialized object index variant). A short term solution
 *       can simply use a hash table to store the name : id mapping.
 * 
 * @todo Object caching, which is part of the OM contract (for reference testing
 *       for equality within a VM). Try this with an inner hard reference queue
 *       instead of an inner LRU hard reference hash table.
 * 
 * @todo Add operations for creating btrees.
 * 
 * @todo Add stream-based operations. Note that very large objects are going to
 *       scale out using an unisolated stream-based API. That API probably
 *       belongs to the {@link IIndexStore} rather than the {@link IOM} since large
 *       streams can not be made transactional (well, they can we a journal
 *       designed for large writes and using a disk-only strategy, but do you
 *       want to bother?) Maybe we should put those methods on IOM so that
 *       people can elect for either isolated or unisolated streams. However,
 *       unisolated streams probably use a very different mechanism, e.g.,
 *       connecting to a stream service that writes directly to disk - but a
 *       disk-only journal would probably work fine for that purpose.
 * 
 * @todo Reconcile with the API for the pluggable backends for generic-native.
 * 
 * @todo Resolve on the behavior when an identifier is not found and when it is
 *       known to be deleted. The journal has one set of semantics here since it
 *       knows when something has been deleted - at least until the tx in which
 *       the delete occurs is GC'd. Those same semantics will probably be
 *       visible to bigdata since the journal's MVCC strategy is the basis for
 *       bigdata's concurrency control. The decision should apply equally to
 *       update() and delete() of a persistent identifier.
