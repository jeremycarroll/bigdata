/**
 * Concrete class knows how to maintain its state.

 * @see ExtensibleSerializerSingleton

 * @author thompsonbry
 * 
 * FIXME This does not handle transactional isolation. The extser state must be
 * store global, highly concurrent and restart safe. Ergo, it really needs to be
 * a service apart from the persistence store.  If it is necessary to realize 
 * within an embedded store and for use by that embedded store, then it seems
 * that the embedded database needs to provide specially for the extser state
 * using low-level operations.  I suppose that we could get away with validating
 * conflicts by re-serializing objects using corrected classId assignments, but
 * extser by design should probably never expose a classId that would then have
 * to be retracted. 
 * 
 * FIXME This implementation is NOT restart safe.
 * 
 * FIXME A standalone implementation (in which the journal is the database) can
 * support extser using metadata in the root block. The metadata is just the
 * {@link ISlotAllocation} on which the current extser state resides. In order
 * to keep the {@link ISlotAllocation} to a fixed size in the root block, we can
 * define another implementation that requires the slot allocation to be
 * contiguous and uses just an offset (of the first slot) and the size (of the
 * allocation in bytes). The #of slots is computed from the size plus the offset
 * of the first slot.
 * 
 * FIXME For bigdata, extser needs to be a high concurrent service so that
 * binary data may be migrated among segments without needing to deserialize
 * and re-serialize the data. Registration of new classes and versions MUST be
 * atomic. There is no means available to unregister a class (logically a write
 * once collection). The extser state can be cached locally by clients, with
 * updates being delivered along with responses to requests. The service itself
 * needs to be replicated and highly available. Persistence for the service can
 * be a journal that grounds out with a specialized static extser instance to
 * handle serialization of index nodes (this is pretty much the only thing that
 * the journal uses extser for itself - the other uses are application facing).
 * 
 * @todo Provide for registration of several classes or versions at once?
