/**
 * <p>
 * This is a marker interface for an index that can be isolated by a
 * transaction. Implementations of this interface understand and maintain both
 * version counters and deletion markers and constrain application data to
 * variable length byte[]s. Both unisolated and isolated indicies MUST use this
 * interface in order to support transactions since version counters MUST be
 * maintained in the unisolated indices as well as the isolated indices.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The basic design for isolation requires that reads are performed against a
 * historical committed state of the store (the ground state, which is typically
 * the last committed state of the store at the time that the transaction
 * begins) while writes are isolated (they are not visible outside of the
 * transaction). The basic mechanism for isolation is a isolated btree that
 * reads through to a read-only btree loaded from a historical metadata record
 * while writes go into the isolated btree. The isolated btree is used by the
 * transaction and never by another transaction.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to commit, the transaction must validate the write set on the
 * isolated btree against the then current committed state of the btree. If
 * there have been no intervening commits then validation is a NOP since the
 * read-only btree that the isolated btree reads through to is the current
 * committed state. If there have been intervening commits, then validation may
 * identify write-write conflicts (read-write conflicts are obviated by the
 * basic design). A write-write conflict exists when a concurrent transaction
 * wrote a record for the same key as the transaction that is being validated
 * and has already committed (conflicts are not visible until a writer has
 * committed). Write-write conflicts may be resolved by data type specific merge
 * rules. Examples include debits and credits on a bank account or conflicts on
 * record metadata but the basic state of the record. If a conflict can not be
 * validated then the transaction is aborted and may be retried.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Once a transaction has validated it is merged down onto the globally visible
 * state of the btree. This process consists simply of applying the changes to
 * the globally visible btree, including both inserts of key-value pairs and
 * removal of keys that were deleted during the transaction.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a transaction is reading from or writing on more than one btree, then it
 * must validate the write set for each btree during its validation stage and
 * merge down the write set for each btree during its merge stage. Once this
 * merge process is complete, the btree is flushed to the backing store which
 * results in a new metadata record. The mapping from btree identifier to btree
 * metadata record is then updated on the backing store. Finally, an atomic
 * commit is then performed on the backing store. At this point the transaction
 * has successfully completed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The use of this interface is NOT required if neither transactions nor
 * partitioned indicies will be used for an index. For example, a temporary
 * index used by some transactions and then discarded rather than participating
 * in a commit need not use this index (e.g., temporary tables or the answer set
 * for some fixed point operation or query).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: Since each batch operation is atomic within an index partition, the
 * {@link IBatchBTree batch api} provides an alternative to transactional
 * isolatation that is suitable for some applications.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: Another alternative to transactional isolation is to append a timestamp
 * or version identifier to the application keys and then use a version
 * expiration policy based on either age or the maximum #of versions to be
 * retained. This approach can be combined with the use of the batch api
 * mentioned above.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @todo each value paired with a key must have a versionCounter and deletion
 *       flag in addition to the value itself. I think that it is best to change
 *       the value to a byte[] since this will place the serialization burden on
 *       the clients, where it belongs, and will further prepare us for a
 *       network api.
 * 
 * @todo The read-only view must be against the partitioned index, not just the
 *       btree on the journal. the UnisolatedBTree is different in that it reads
 *       against a view and writes on the UnisolatedBTree. In fact, this is
 *       precisely how the PartitionedIndex works already. All that we have to
 *       do is to construct the view from the historical committed state from
 *       which the transaction emerges. In order to do this, we need to be able
 *       to recover prior historical states of btrees which we could do by
 *       chaining their metadata records or by maintaining the timestamp in the
 *       key in the Name2BTree mapping (much like a column store). We also must
 *       keep old journals and index segments around even after their data has
 *       been evicted onto index segments until there are no longer any active
 *       transactions which could read from a ground state found on a given
 *       journal + index segments.
 * 
 * @todo handle journal overflow smoothly with respect to transactional
 *       isolation, including how to handle both short and long-lived readers
 *       and writers. draw some boundaries on what is supported and what is not.
 *       a long-lived transaction can evict data onto the journal and have it
 *       overflow onto index segments. that presents a scalable approach, but we
 *       must then delete the index segments for the isolated transaction when
 *       it commmits. this requires a persistent index to keep track of the
 *       transactional indices. the simplest thing to do is register an index
 *       specifically for this purpose. the minimum information is to enter a tx
 *       into the index when a journal overflows and the tx has data evicted
 *       into an index segment. When the tx completes, its indexs segments are
 *       deleted and its entry in the transactions index is removed. On restart
 *       any index segments for transactions are deleted since any transaction
 *       which was running must have failed.
 * 
 * @todo is double-deletion of a deleted key on an isolated btree is an error or
 *       should it be silently ignored?
 *

 * 
 * FIXME review all implementations of this interface, plus the
 * {@link IndexSegmentMerger} and {@link IndexSegment} for correct detection and
 * handling of deletion markers. Review applications for correct use of
 * {@link BTree} vs {@link UnisolatedBTree}.
 * 
 * @todo support transactions {@link Tx} on the {@link Journal} and bring back
 *       the test suite for transactional isolation or just write a new one.
 * 
 * @todo update the basic merge rule in {@link IndexSegmentMerger} so that it
 *       will process delete markers.
 * 
 * @todo update {@link Leaf} to understand delete markers and define a btree
 *       mode in which delete markers are used and then write tests of that mode
 *       since the behavior differs significantly, e.g., when a key is deleted
 *       the #of entries in the tree does not change and the #of spanned keys
 *       does not change, and we do not actually remove the entry from the leaf.
 *       Note: the _use_ of the btree needs to change when supporting
 *       transactions since all application values MUST be wrapped up as Value
 *       objects. This means that methods such as
 *       {@link AbstractBTree#contains(byte[])} must be overriden so as to
 *       correctly process delete markers (this applies to the batch api as
 *       well). The place to do this is probably where the btrees are created
 *       using an IsolatedBtree class (extends BTree or perhaps just implements
 *       {@link IIndex} so that we can use it in combination with the FusedView
 *       to support partitioned indices). FusedView will also need to be
 *       modified to support delete markers and could thrown an exception if the
 *       version counters were out of the expected order (so could the leaf
 *       merge iterator). The UnisolatedBTree would always use the
 *       {@link ValueSerializer} and applications would become responsible for
 *       serializing values before insert (we could serialize them on the index
 *       side but then we have much more network IO).
 *       <p>
 *       The only time to de-serialize the application values is when there is a
 *       write-write conflict and a conflict resolver registered on the btree to
 *       handle that conflict).
