/**
 * <p>
 * A B+-Tree that has been isolated by a transaction (a write set for an index
 * isolated by that transactions). In general, this class inherits the
 * observable semantics of an {@link UnisolatedBTree} with the addition of
 * read-through on a miss to the backing btree and the interpretation of delete
 * markers in the write set.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link ISimpleBTree#insert(Object, Object) Writes} will be applied to this
 * {@link IsolatedBtree}. Reads ({@link ISimpleBTree#contains(byte[])) or {@link ISimpleBTree#lookup(Object)}
 * will read first on the {@link IsolatedBtree} and then read through to the
 * immutable {@link UnisolatedBTree} specified in the constructor iff no entry
 * is found under the key. {@link ISimpleBTree#remove(Object) Deletes} leave
 * "delete markers" in the write set.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link IBatchBTree} interface provides a convenience for iterative
 * operations using the corresponding {@link ISimpleBTree} method and shares the
 * semantics for that interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #rangeCount(byte[], byte[])} method MAY report more entries in a
 * key range that would actually be visited by
 * {@link #rangeIterator(byte[], byte[])} - this is due to both the presence of
 * "delete marker" entries in the {@link IsolatedBTree} and the requirement to
 * read on a fused view of the writes on the {@link IsolatedBTree} and the
 * read-only {@link UnisolatedBTree}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link ILinearList} interface implemented by this class applies solely to
 * the entries in the write set. The interface specifically does NOT support a
 * fused view on the entry set of both the write set and the isolated index.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to commit the changes in an {@link IsolatedBTree} onto the backing
 * {@link UnisolatedBTree} the writes must be
 * {@link #validate(UnisolatedBTree) validated},
 * {@link #mergeDown(UnisolatedBTree) merged down}, and the dirty nodes and
 * leaves in the {@link UnisolatedBTree} must be {@link BTree#write() written}
 * onto the store. Finally, the store must record the new metadata record for
 * the source btree in a root block and commit. This protocol can be generalized
 * to allow multiple btrees to be isolated and commit atomically within the same
 * transaction. On abort, it is possible that nodes and leaves were written on
 * the store for the {@link IsolatedBtree}. Those data are unreachable and the
 * storage allocated to them MAY be reclaimed as part of the abort processing.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo consider disabling the {@link ILinearList} interface for this class
 *       since its behavior might surprise people. Alternatively, is there some
 *       slick way to realize the proper semantics for this interface on a fused
 *       view of the write set and the immutable index isolated by this class?
 * 
 * FIXME I have not finished working through the fused view support for this
 * class.
