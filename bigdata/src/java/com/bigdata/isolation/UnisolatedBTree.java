/**
 * <p>
 * A scalable mutable B+-Tree mapping variable length unsigned byte[] keys to
 * byte[] values that is capable of being isolated by a transaction and supports
 * deletion markers. Application values are transparently encapsulated in
 * {@link IValue} object which keep track of version counters (in support of
 * transactions) and deletion markers (in support of both transactions and
 * partitioned indices). Users of this interface will only see application
 * values, not {@link IValue} objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that {@link #rangeCount(byte[], byte[])} MAY report more entries than
 * would actually be visited. This is because it depends on
 * {@link #indexOf(byte[])} and the internal counts of the #of spanned entries
 * for a node do not differentiate between entries which have and have not been
 * {@link IValue#isDeleted() deleted}.

 * @see IsolatedBTree, a {@link BTree} that has been isolated by a transaction.
 *
 * The following is an ad-hoc summary of the behavior of some methods exposed by
 * this class:
<pre>

contains() - done.
insert() - done.
remove() - done.
lookup() - done.

addAll() - ok as implemented.  values will be wrapped in {@link IValue} objects
as they are inserted.  if the source is also an {@link UnisolatedBTree} then the
application values will be inserted into this tree, not the {@link IValue} objects.

indexOf() - ok as implemented (counts deleted entries).
keyAt() - ok as implemented, but will return keys for deleted entries.
valueAt() - overriden to return null for a deleted entry.

rangeCount - ok as implemented (counts deleted entries).
rangeIterator - must filter out deleted entries.

entryIterator() - only non-deleted entries.

IBatchBTree - all methods are overriden to use {@link IBatchOp#apply(ISimpleBTree)}
so that they will correctly apply the semantics of the {@link UnisolatedBTree}.
