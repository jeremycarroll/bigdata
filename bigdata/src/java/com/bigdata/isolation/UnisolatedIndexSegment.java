/**
 * <p>
 * A scalable read-only B+-Tree mapping variable length unsigned byte[] keys to
 * byte[] values that is capable of being isolated by a transaction (it
 * maintains version counters) and supports deletion markers. Application data
 * are transparently encapsulated in {@link IValue} objects which keep track of
 * version counters (in support of transactions) and deletion markers (in
 * support of both transactions and partitioned indices). Users of this class
 * will only see application values, not {@link IValue} objects.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @see UnisolatedBTree, which provides a mutable implementation with a similar
 *      contract.
 * 
 * @todo This class should either share code or tests cases with
 *       {@link UnisolatedBTree} (I just copied over the logic for non-mutation
 *       operations). There are no direct tests of this class at this time.
 * 
 * @todo define extension that stores the index name for a named index to which
 *       the segment belongs (add method to {@link AbstractBTree} to allow
 *       subclassing {@link IndexSegmentExtensionMetadata})? (Note that we
 *       already store the indexUUID and indices might be renamed so this may
 *       not be a good idea).
 * 
 * @todo add a boolean flag to mark index segments that are the final result of
 *       a compacting merge. This will make it possible to reconstruct from the
 *       file system which index segments are part of the consistent state for a
 *       given restart time.
 * 
 * @todo consider caching the first/last key in support of both correct
 *       rejection of queries directed to the wrong index segment and managing
 *       the metadataMap for a distributed index (it could be part of the
 *       extension metadata record).
