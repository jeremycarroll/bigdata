/**
 * An read-only {@link IFusedView} that supports transactions and deletion
 * markers.
 * <p>
 * Processing deletion markers requires that the source(s) for an index
 * partition view are read in order from the most recent to the earliest
 * historical resource. The first entry for the key in any source is the value
 * that will be reported on a read. If the entry is deleted, then the read will
 * report that no entry exists for that key.
 * <p>
 * Note that deletion markers can exist in both historical journals and index
 * segments having data for the view. Deletion markers are expunged from index
 * segments only by a full compacting merge of all index segments having life
 * data for the partition.
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: the {@link IBatchBTree} operations are inherited from
 * the base class. Only non-batch read operations are overriden by this class.
 * 
 * FIXME implement; support processing of delete markers (including handling of
 * the merge rule) - basically they have to be processed on read so that a
 * delete on the mutable btree overrides an historical value, and a deletion
 * marker in a more recent index segment overrides a deletion marker in an
 * earlier index segment. Deletion markers can exist in the both mutable btree
 * and in index segments that are not either a clean first eviction or a full
 * compacting merge (e.g., they can still exist in a compacting merge if there
 * are other index segments or btrees that are part of a partition but are not
 * partitipating in the compacting merge).
