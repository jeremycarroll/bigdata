     * Execute the program.
     * <p>
     * First, locate the distinct relations on which the rules will write. The
     * rules will all write on a buffer. The type of buffer is choosen based on
     * Query vs Insert or Delete (mutation). If we are reading from the rule,
     * then it writes on a {@link IBlockingBuffer} and we return the
     * {@link IChunkedOrderedIterator} that drains that {@link IBlockingBuffer}.
     * If we are writing on a relation (insert or delete) then we use an
     * {@link AbstractArrayBuffer} that flushes onto the appropriate method on
     * the {@link IMutableRelation}.
     * @throws Exception 
     * 
     * @todo it should be possible to have a different action associated with
     *       each rule in the program, and to have a different target relation
     *       for the head of each rule on which we will write (mutation).
     *       Different query or mutation count results could be handled by an
     *       extension with "nextResultSet" style semantics. However, for now,
     *       all rules MUST write on the same buffer. Query results will
     *       therefore be multiplexed as will mutations counts.
     * 
     * @todo return mutation count (and other rule stats). Perhaps as metadata
     *       available from an interface extending Future?
     * 
     * @todo return Future{IChunkedOrderedIterator} to client for query. Client
     *       can cancel or get the result and even cancel once they have the
     *       result since the JOIN will continue to run until finished and will
     *       block when the buffer is full and continue as the iterator drains
     *       the buffer. Closing the iterator will cancel the JOIN.
     * 
     * @todo Doing this for a remote data service means that we need to make
     *       both the Future and the IChunkedOrderedIterator objects that wrap
     *       internal proxy objects doing RMI do the remove implementations. The
     *       data service will need to maintain a weak value map of the futures
     *       that it is executing.
     * 
     * FIXME The iterator returned by the JOIN for a QUERY needs be a proxy for
     * the remote iterator running on the data service that is actually
     * executing that proxy. When the iterator is closed by the client the close
     * needs to make it back to the data service where it must cancel the
     * Future(s) writing on the buffer.
     * 
     * FIXME submit the tasks from within a controller thread so that we can
     * return the caller as soon as the JOIN starts to execute. (If the JOIN
     * only produces a small result set then we are better off returning the
     * solutions in an array-backed buffer).
     * 
     * Note: The alterative approach is the one used with the iterator - it
     * explicitly resends a request after consuming each result set. It it is
     * easy to describe the execution state of the iterator, but it may be
     * possible to describe the JOIN execution state in a similar manner.
     * 
     * @todo it should be possible to handle different relation classes in the
     *       same rules, e.g., RDF and non-RDF relations. Or even the SPO and
     *       lexicon relation for the RDF DB -- the latter will be useful for
     *       materializing extenalized statements efficiently.
