<p>

    This package includes an abstraction layer for access paths, rules (JOINs), and evaluation
    of those rules.  The class of rules is conjunctive query.  Negation is not supported, except
    within constraints.  There is support for reading on fused views which can be useful for
    transaction processing and truth maintenance.
