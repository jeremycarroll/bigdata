/**
 * Mutable program may be used to create a variety of rule executions.
 * 
 * FIXME Refactor into "programs", aka, collections of rules to be run in
 * sequence and/or in parallel. The focusStore stuff needs to be a rewritten as
 * a rule (and program) rewrite in order to map the predicates correctly across
 * the db and the focusStore. Most of the "programs" allow the rules to run in
 * parallel and the fixedPoint support assumes that the order of rule execution
 * does not matter, but that the re-behind point changes with each iterator. The
 * counter example is the "fast" closure method - that is a specific sequence of
 * both custom and standard rules than runs once rather than to fixed point
 * (some of the rules in the program are run to fixed point so that needs to be
 * a program control parameter in addition to sequential vs parallel execution).
