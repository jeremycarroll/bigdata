/**
 * Interface for a set of bindings. The set of variables values is extensible
 * and the bound values are loosely typed.
 * 
 * @todo The variable positions in a binding set can be assigned an index by the
 *       order in which they are encountered across the predicates when the
 *       predicates are considered in execution order. This gives us a dense
 *       index in [0:nvars-1]. The index can be into an array. When the bindings
 *       are of a primitive type, as they are for the RDF DB, that array can be
 *       an array of the primitive type, e.g., long[nvars].
 *       <p>
 *       This change would require that the singleton factory for a variable was
 *       on the {@link Rule} (different rules would have different index
 *       assignments), it would require predicates to be cloned into a
 *       {@link Rule} so that the variables possessed the necessary index
 *       assignment, and that index assignment would have to be late - once the
 *       evaluation order was determined, so maybe the Rule is cloned into the
 *       {@link RuleState} once we have the evaluation order.
 *       <p>
 *       There would also need to be a type-specific means for copying bindings
 *       from a visited element into a bindingSet if a want to avoid autoboxing.
 *       <p>
 *       The {@link IConstant} interface might have to disappear for this as
 *       well. I am not convinced that it adds much.
