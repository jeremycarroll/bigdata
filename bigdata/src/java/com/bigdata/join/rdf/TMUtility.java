/**
 * A utility class for performing rule re-writes for RDF truth maintenance using
 * a "focusStore" in addition to the primary database. The focusStore is
 * typically used in one of two ways: (1) incremental loading of new data into
 * the database; and (2) collecting entailments of statements that are being
 * removed during truth maintenance.
 * <p>
 * Note: When loading a new data set into the database, the "focusStore" should
 * contain the statements that were read from the data source, e.g., some
 * RDF/XML file and the "buffer" should be configured to write on the
 * "database".

     * Truth maintenance for RDF needs to compute the entailments <i>as if</i>
     * the statements in a temporary triple store (known as the focusStore) were
     * already part of the database (for insert) or as if they had already been
     * removed (for delete). Given a single rule with N predicates in the tail,
     * we generate N new rules that we will run <em>instead of</em> the
     * original rule. For each of those N new rules, we set the relation for
     * tail[i] to <i>focusIndex</i>. When the new rule is run, tail[i] will
     * read from the [focusStore] rather than the original database. All other
     * predicates in the tail will read from the fused view of the [focusStore]
     * and the [database]. As a special case, when the rule has a single
     * predicate in the tail, the predicate is only run against the
     * <i>focusStore</i> rather than database or the fused view [focusStore +
     * database]. For all cases, the head of the rule is unchanged.
     * 
     * @param rule
     *            The original rule. The {@link IPredicate}s in this
     *            {@link Rule} should identify the {@link IRelation} for the
     *            database for which truth maintenance will be performed.
     * @param focusStore
     *            The temporary database containing the statements to be added
     *            to (or removed from) the database during truth maintenance.
     * 
     * @return A list of rules constructed as specified above. When they are
     *         executed, all of the resulting rules should write on the same
     *         buffer. This has the same effect as a UNION over the entailments
     *         of the individual rules.
