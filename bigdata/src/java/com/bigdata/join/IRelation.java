/**
 * An abstraction corresponding to a set of elements using some schema.
 * 
 * FIXME An {@link IRelation} introduces a dependency on access to the data. if
 * {@link IPredicate} knows its owning {@link IRelation} then rules can not be
 * written outside of the context of the data. it might be better to create a
 * binding between the predicates in a rule and the data source(s). that binding
 * really needs to be symbolic since the data sources can not be passed by value
 * when within a distributed JOIN. Instead they need to be things like the
 * timestamp for the view (including the case of a checkpoint that evolves when
 * bringing a rule set to fixed point) and the namespace of the scale out triple
 * store so that we can locate the various index partitions. And if they are
 * symbolic then we need a means to convert them to functional objects that can
 * materialize access paths that actually read or write on the appropriate
 * relation.
 * <p>
 * We need to bind the relation to the protocol for accessing that relation
 * whenever we want to request anything for the relation. That binding needs to
 * be (re-)established when reading rules from a file or when a data service
 * receives a (part of a) rule for remote execution as part of a distributed
 * JOIN.
 * <p>
 * It is perfectly reasonable for rules to write on a temporary index and there
 * should be a facility for creating and destroying temporary indices. Perhaps
 * they should be placed into their own namespace, e.g., "#x" would be a
 * temporary index named "x" (could support scale-out) and "##x" would be a
 * data-service local temporary index named "x". "x" by itself is a normal
 * index.  Normally, such temporary indices should be scoped to something like
 * a transaction but transaction support is not yet finished.
 * 
 * FIXME Allow the head of a rule to return [null] for getRelation() so that
 * query via rules can work even when there is no specific relation that
 * corresponds to the head of the rule?
 * <P>
 * Is there no relation in the head or is this how we handle query (no relation,
 * results are written onto a buffer for eventual read by a client aka SELECT)
 * vs write (write on the relation via a suitable buffering mechanism aka
 * INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)?
 * 
 * @todo Note that a different subset of bindings might be used when feeding
 *       another JOIN.
 * 
 * @todo the buffer will require access to the {@link IBigdataClient} when
 *       feeding another JOIN using the distributed federation.
 *
