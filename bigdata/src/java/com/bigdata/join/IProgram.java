/**
 * A program consists of a set of rules and/or programs. Some programs are
 * executed sequentially while others are (at least logically) parallel. A
 * program may also specify the transitive closure of its rules.
 * 
 * @todo add an XML (de-)serialization for programs and rules so that the rule
 *       sets may be declared. Note that there are a few very specialized rules
 *       whose semantics might not be fully declarable for the fast closure
 *       method used by the RDF KB.
 * 
 * @todo Make it possible for people to easily extend the RDF KB rule sets or
 *       run rules over a RDF data set, but note that there are interactions in
 *       the rules choosen for evaluation during forward closure and those
 *       choosen for evaluation at query time.
