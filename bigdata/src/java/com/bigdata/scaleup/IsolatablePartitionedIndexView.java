/**
 * A {@link PartitionedIndexView} that supports transactions and deletion
 * markers. Write operations are passed through to the base class, which in turn
 * delegates them to the {@link UnisolatedBTree} identified to the constructor.
 * Read operations understand deletion markers. Processing deletion markers
 * requires that the source(s) for an index partition view are read in order
 * from the most recent (the mutable btree that is absorbing writes for the
 * index partition) to the earliest historical resource. The first entry for the
 * key in any source is the value that will be reported on a read. If the entry
 * is deleted, then the read will report that no entry exists for that key.
 * <p>
 * Note that deletion markers can exist in both the mutable btree absorbing
 * writes and in historical journals and index segments having data for the
 * partition view. Deletion markers are expunged from index segments only by a
 * full compacting merge of all index segments having life data for the
 * partition.
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: the write operations are inherited from the base class.
 * Only read operations are overriden by this class.
 * 
 * FIXME implement; support processing of delete markers - basically they have
 * to be processed on read so that a delete on the mutable btree overrides an
 * historical value, and a deletion marker in a more recent index segment
 * overrides a deletion marker in an earlier index segment. Deletion markers can
 * exist in the both mutable btree and in index segments that are not either a
 * clean first eviction or a full compacting merge (e.g., they can still exist
 * in a compacting merge if there are other index segments or btrees that are
 * part of a partition but are not partitipating in the compacting merge).
