/**
 * A mutable B+-Tree that is dynamically partitioned into one or more key
 * ranges. Each key range is a <i>partition</i>. A partition is defined by the
 * lowest value key that can enter that partition (the separator key). A
 * {@link MetadataIndex} contains the definitions of the partitions. Each
 * partition has a mutable {@link BTree} that will absorb writes for a
 * partition. The same {@link BTree} is used to absorb writes distined for any
 * partitions of the same index on the same {@link Journal}. This class
 * internally tracks whether or not a write has occurred on each partition. That
 * information is used to guide eviction decisions when the
 * {@link Journal#overflow()}s and buffered writes are migrated onto one or
 * more {@link IndexSegment}s each of which contains historical read-only data
 * for a single index partition.
 * <p>
 * Writes on a {@link PartitionIndex} simply write through to the {@link BTree}
 * corresponding to that index (having the same name) on the
 * {@link Journal journal} (they are effectively multiplexed on the journal).
 * <p>
 * Read operations process the spanned partitions sequence so that the
 * aggregated results are in index order. For each partition, the read request
 * is constructed using ah {@link IFusedView} of the mutable {@link BTree} used
 * to absorb writes and the live {@link IndexSegment}s for that partition.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo add a restart safe data counter for each index partition that may be
 *       used to assign 64-bit unique identifiers in conjunction with the 32-bit
 *       unique (within index) partition identifier assigned by the
 *       {@link MetadataIndex} to each index partition.
 * 
 * @todo add a restart safe data structure tracking each partition for which
 *       writes have been absorbed on the {@link Journal}. this could be just
 *       an ordered set of partition identifiers for which writes have been
 *       absorbed that is maintained by an insertion sort, an ordered array of
 *       <partId:writeCounter>, or a btree mapping partition identifiers to
 *       write counters. The data need to be associated as part of the metadata
 *       for the btree that is absorbing writes for that partition. The simplest
 *       way to do this is to subclass BTree or UnisolatedBTree so that they are
 *       partition aware and automatically track the #of writes destined for
 *       each partition.
 * 
 * @todo For a scale-out solution the clients are responsible for talking with
 *       the metadata service and locating the data service for each partition.
 *       The client is responsible for directing the writes to the correct data
 *       service. The data service simply fronts for the journal and directs the
 *       writes onto the {@link BTree} absorbing writes for the named index. It
 *       is a (client) error for a write to be directed to a {@link Journal} not
 *       tasked with buffering data for the partition into which that write
 *       should go.
