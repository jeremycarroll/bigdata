 * Abstract base class for tasks that build {@link IndexSegment}(s).
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo write test suite for executing partition task schedules.
 * 
 * @todo add a
 *       {@link Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor(java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory)}
 *       that will be used to run these tasks and modify the shutdown logic
 *       for the master to also shutdown that thread.
 * 
 * @todo add result to persistent schedule outcome so that this is restart
 *       safe.
 * 
 * @todo once the {@link IndexSegment} is ready the metadata index needs to
 *       be updated to reflect that the indexsegment is live and the views
 *       that rely on the partition on the old journal need to be
 *       invalidated so new views utilize the new indexsegment rather than
 *       the data on the old journal.
 * 
 * @todo the old journal is not available for release until all partitions
 *       for all indices have been evicted. we need to track that in a
 *       restart safe manner.
 * 
 * @todo parameterize useChecksum, recordCompressor.
 * 
 * @todo try performance with and without checksums and with and without
 *       record compression.
