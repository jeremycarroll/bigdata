/**
 * A metadata index for the partitions of a distributed index. There is one
 * metadata index for each distributed index. The keys of the metadata index are
 * the first key that would be directed into the corresponding index segment,
 * e.g., a <em>separator key</em> (this is just the standard btree semantics).
 * Keys in the metadata index are updated as index partitions are split (or
 * joined). Splits are performed when the fully compacted partition exceeds
 * ~200M. Joins of index segments are performed when sibling partitions could be
 * merged to produce a partition of ~100M. Splitting and joining partitions is
 * atomic and respects transaction isolation.
 * 
 * @todo split/join logic.
 * 
 * @todo locator logic on a cluster (a socket address in addition to the other
 *       information).
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo define a UUID so that is at least possible to rename a partitioned
 *       index? the uuid would be store in the metadata record for the metadata
 *       index and in each index segment generated for that metadata index. we
 *       could also define a partition uuid. finally, each btree and index
 *       segment could have its own uuid. the index segment would also carry the
 *       uuid of the partition and the partitioned index.  This would also make
 *       it possible to determine which index segments belong to which partitions
 *       of which partitioned indices and effectively reconstruct the metadata
 *       index for a partitioned index from the data on the ground.
