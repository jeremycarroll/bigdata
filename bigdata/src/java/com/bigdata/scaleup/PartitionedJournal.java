/**
 * <p>
 * A store that supports {@link PartitionedIndex}s.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@link PartitionedIndex} is an {@link IIndex} that is dynamically
 * decomposed into key-range partitions. Each partition is defined by a
 * <i>separator key</i>. The separator key is the first key that may be
 * inserted into, or read from, that partition. A total ordering over partitions
 * and their locations is maintained in a {@link MetadataIndex}. An insert or
 * read is directed to the first partition having a separator key greater than
 * or equal to the probe key.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An index partition is comprised of a {@link Journal} having a {@link BTree}
 * that buffers writes for that partition and zero or more {@link IndexSegment}s
 * per partition. The relationship between keys and partitions is managed by a
 * {@link MetadataIndex}. Partitions may be multiplexed onto the same
 * {@link Journal} in order to reduce the #of disk files that are being actively
 * written and maximize the use of sequential IO on a given IO channel.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All writes bound for any partition of any index are absorbed on the
 * {@link Journal} to which that partition has been assigned. For each
 * {@link PartitionedIndex}, there is a corresponding {@link BTree} that
 * absorbs writes (including deletes) on the {@link Journal}. The
 * {@link PartitionedJournal} actually delegates all storage services to a
 * {@link SlaveJournal}. When the {@link SlaveJournal} {@link #overflow()}s,
 * it is frozen and a new {@link SlaveJournal} is deployed to absorb further
 * writes. During this time, reads on the {@link PartitionedJournal} are served
 * by a {@link FusedView} of the data on the new {@link SlaveJournal} and the
 * data on the old {@link SlaveJournal}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * While reads and writes proceed in the foreground on the new
 * {@link SlaveJournal}, a background thread builds an {@link IndexSegment}
 * from each modified {@link BTree} corresponding to a {@link PartitionedIndex}.
 * Note that we would be free to delete the old {@link SlaveJournal} and old
 * {@link IndexSegment}s except that concurrent transactions may still need to
 * read from historical states which would be lost by the merge. However,
 * unisolated read and write operations and new transactions immediately begin
 * to use the new {@link IndexSegment}s.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If there is an existing {@link IndexSegment} for a partition then a
 * compacting merge MAY be performed. Otherwise a new {@link IndexSegment} is
 * generated, possibly resulting in more than one {@link IndexSegment} for the
 * same partition. Once all data from the {@link SlaveJournal} are stable in the
 * appropriate {@link IndexSegment}s, the old {@link SlaveJournal} is no longer
 * required for unisolated reads or writes or for new transactions (however, it
 * MAY be required to serve existing transactions reading from historical states
 * that are no longer present in the merged index segments). Each
 * {@link IndexSegment} built in this manner contains a snapshot of surviving
 * data written on {@link Journal} for a given partition. If multiple
 * {@link IndexSegment} are allowed to accumulate per partition, then the
 * {@link IndexSegment}s are combined periodically using a compacting merge
 * (responsible for retaining the most recent versions for any key and
 * processing delete markers). The inputs to a compacting merge are then no
 * longer required by unisolated reads or writes but MAY be required to support
 * concurrent transactions reading from historical states not preserved by the
 * merge.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An index partition overflows and is split when the total data size of an
 * index partition (estimated as the sum of the {@link IndexSegment}s and the
 * data on the {@link Journal} for that partition) exceeds a threshold.
 * Likewise, index partitions may underflow and be joined. These operations
 * require updates to the {@link MetadataIndex} so that futher requests are
 * directed based on the new partition boundaries.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Either once the journal is frozen or periodically during its life we would
 * evict an index to a perfect index segment on disk (write the leaves out in a
 * linear sequence, complete with prior-next references, and build up a perfect
 * index over those leaves - the branching factor here can be much higher in
 * order to reduce the tree depth and optimize IO). The perfect index would have
 * to have "delete" entries to mark deleted keys. Periodically we would merge
 * evicted index segments. The goal is to balance write absorbtion and
 * concurrency control within memory and using pure sequantial IO against 100:1
 * or better data on disk with random seeks for reading any given leaf. The
 * index nodes would be written densely after the leaves such that it would be
 * possible to fully buffer the index nodes with a single sequential IO. A key
 * range scan would likewise be a sequential IO since we would know the start
 * and end leaf for the key range directly from the index. A read would first
 * resolve against the current journal, then the prior journal iff one is in the
 * process of be paritioned out into individual perfect index segments, and then
 * against those index segments in order. A "point" read would therefore be
 * biased to be more efficient for "recently" written data, but reads otherwise
 * must present a merged view of the data in each remaining historical perfect
 * index that covers at least part of the key range. Periodically the index
 * segments could be fully merged, at which point we would no longer have any
 * delete entries in a given perfect index segment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * At one extreme there will be one journal per disk and the journal will use
 * the entire disk partition. In a pure write scenario the disk would perform
 * only sequential IO. However, applications will also need to read data from
 * disk. Read and write buffers need to be split. Write buffers are used to
 * defer IOs until large sequential IOs may be realized. Read buffers are used
 * for pre-fetching when the data on disk is much larger than the available RAM
 * and the expectation of reuse is low while the expectation of completing a
 * sequential scan is high. Direct buffering may be used for hot-spots but
 * requires a means to bound the locality of the buffered segment, e.g., by not
 * multiplexing an index segment that will be directly buffered and providing a
 * sufficient resource abundence for high performance.
 * <p>
 * 
 * @todo When you open an index segment the nodes are fully buffered, so that
 *       will absorb an increasing amount of RAM as we get more segments on a
 *       server. The reason to buffer the index segment nodes is that you have
 *       to do only one IO per leaf to read any data that may be in the segment
 *       relevant to a query. In the end both RAM consumption and random seeks
 *       for index segment leaves will probably prove to be the limited factors
 *       on the capacity of a server. We could evict, e.g., close, segments that
 *       are not being queried to help stave off RAM starvation and we could
 *       fully buffer the leaves for very hot index segments to help stave off
 *       IO congestion. I don’t have the data today to estimate the proportion
 *       of an index segment that is the nodes (vs the leaves). It will depend
 *       on the size of the values stored in the leaves, but generally the
 *       leaves are much larger than the nodes of the tree. Beyond that you need
 *       to get into a scale out (aka distributed) architecture.
 * 
 * @todo A scale out implementation must refactor the scale up design into a
 *       client API, protocol, a robust service for index metadata management,
 *       and a distributed protocol for access to the various index partitions.
 * 
 * @todo I've been considering the problem of a distributed index more. A
 *       mutiplexed journal holding segments for one or more clustered indices
 *       (containing anything from database rows to generic objects to terms to
 *       triples) would provide fast write absorption and good read rates
 *       without a secondary read-optimized segment. If this is combined with
 *       pipelined journals for per-index segment redundency (a given segment is
 *       replicated on N=3+ hosts) then we can have both failover and
 *       load-balancing for read-intensive segments.
 *       <p>
 *       Clustered indices support (re-)distribution and redundency since their
 *       rows are their essential data while the index simply provides efficient
 *       access. Therefore the same objects may be written onto multiple
 *       replications of an index range hosted by different journals. The object
 *       data will remain invariant, but the entailed index data will be
 *       different for each journal on which the object is written.
 *       <p>
 *       This requires a variety of metadata for each index segment. If a
 *       segment is defined by an index identifier and a separator key, then the
 *       metadata model needs to identify the master journal for a given segment
 *       (writes are directed to this journal) and the secondary journals for
 *       the segment (the master writes through to the secondary journals using
 *       a pipeline). Likewise, the journal must be able to identify the root
 *       for any given committed state of each index range written on that
 *       journal.
 *       <p>
 *       We need to track write load and read load per index range in the
 *       journal, per journal, per IO channel, per disk, per host, and per
 *       network segment. Write load can be reduced by splitting a segment, by
 *       using a host with faster resources, or by reducing other utilization of
 *       the host. The latter would include the case of preferring reads from a
 *       secondary journal for that index segment. It is an extremely cheap
 *       action to offload readers to a secondary service. Likewise, failover of
 *       the master for an index range is also inexpensive since the data are
 *       already in place on several secondaries,
 *       <p>
 *       A new replication of an index range may be built up gradually, e.g., by
 *       moving a leaf at a time and piplining only the sub-range of the index
 *       range that has been already mirrored. For simplicity, the new copy of
 *       the index range would not be visible in the index metadata until a full
 *       copy of the index range was life. Registration of the copy with the
 *       metadata index is then trivial. Until that time, the metadata index
 *       would only know that a copy was being developed. If one of the existing
 *       replicas is not heavily loaded then it can handle the creation of the
 *       new copy.

     * <li> Implement the same interfaces as Journal, but delegate to a Journal.
     * </li>
     * <li>Initialize the metadata index with a single partition for each named
     * btree that is registered on the Journal. </li>
     * <li> Detect overflow only at commit and extend the slave as necessary
     * until the next commit. </li>
     * <li> On overflow, open a Journal using the same strategy, copy the
     * metadata index over into the new slave. Synchronously, evict all
     * partitions written on for all btrees written on in the old slave onto
     * index segments. If there is an existing index segment, then use a
     * compacting merge. Finally, update the delegation logic to use a fused
     * view for reads against each partition of each btree. The inputs to that
     * fused view are the named mutable btree on new slave and the corresponding
     * index segment.</li>

     * The above does not introduce new partitions. It should examine the #of
     * entries in a btree and estimate the size per entry based on the
     * historically evicted segment(s) for that btree. If the size per entry
     * times the expected number of entries per-compacting merge would exceed
     * 200M the choose a separator key from keyAt(indexOf(nentries/2)) on either
     * the mutable btree or the index segment, which ever has more data.
     * </p>
     * 
     * FIXME handle the {@link CommitRecordIndex} during overflow. This can
     * either be handled like the metadata indices (with a secondary index) or
     * by extending the {@link CommitRecordIndex} so as to carry more
     * information about {@link SlaveJournal} locations for commit records.
     * 
     * @todo implement asynchronous overflow.
     * @todo implement using compacting merges only.
     * @todo implement using non-compacting merges only.
     * @todo implement strategy that trades off the use of compacting and
     *       non-compacting merges.
     * 
     * @todo Support dynamic split/join of partitions.
     * 
     * @todo Regardless of whether one or many partitioned trees are on the
     *       slave then an export of that tree into an index segment will result
     *       in an mostly random read over the address space since the order
     *       which nodes and leaves are written onto the slave does not
     *       correspond directly to the total ordering of the btree. if the
     *       slave is in disk-only mode then it makes sense to slurp the entire
     *       disk file into a buffer during the export process to reduce
     *       multiple disk seeks with a single sequential read. the buffer can
     *       be discarded as soon as the btrees have been exported onto their
     *       various segment(s).
     * 
     * @todo (javadoc) Keys in the metadata index are updated as index
     *       partitions are split (or joined). Splits are performed when the
     *       fully compacted partition exceeds ~200M. Joins of index segments
     *       are performed when sibling partitions could be merged to produce a
     *       partition of ~100M. Splitting and joining partitions is atomic and
     *       respects transaction isolation.
