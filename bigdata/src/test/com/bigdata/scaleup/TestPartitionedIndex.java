/**
 * Test suite for {@link PartitionedIndex}.
 * 
 * @todo This should be refactored to test when using {@link BTree} as well as
 *       {@link UnisolatedBTree}. The latter is more important for database
 *       operations as it supports isolation and column stores.  Changing over
 *       from {@link BTree} to {@link UnisolatedBTree} highlights many assumptions
 *       in {@link IndexSegmentBuilder}, {@link IndexSegmentMerger}, and the
 *       code that handles {@link PartitionedJournal#overflow()}.
 * 
 * @todo where possible, it would be nice to leverage the unit tests for the
 *       mutable btree. note that rangeCount does not have the same behavior for
 *       a view since it reports the sum of the counts across the sources rather
 *       than computing the exact #of keys in the range. However, most other
 *       aspects of the view are true to the btree api.
 * 
 * @todo also test restart safety.
