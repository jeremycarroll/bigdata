/**
 * Unit tests for splitting an index segment based on its size on the disk, the
 * nominal size of an index partition, and an optional application level
 * constraint on the choice of the separator keys. This approach presumes a
 * compacting merge has been performed such that all history other than the
 * buffered writes is on a single index segment. The buffered writes are not
 * considered when choosing the #of splits to make and the separator keys for
 * those splits. They are simply copied afterwards onto the new index partition
 * which covers their key-range.

     *       pretty unlikely!).
     *       <p>
     *       Note: The {@link SparseRowStore} constraint is also easy. We just
     *       need to find/create a separator key which is equal to some
     *       {schema+primaryKey}. The same concerns about the left/right
