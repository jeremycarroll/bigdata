/**
 * Stress tests of the {@link BTree} writing on the {@link Journal}. This does
 * NOT include the use of the {@link BTree} to provide an object index of for
 * the journal - those tests require reading and write data on the journal using
 * its high-level API. Rather, this suite simply contains stress tests of the
 * btree operations at larger scale and including incremental writes against the
 * store.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * FIXME These tests are still failing.  I have a test design to prove out the
 * incremental write case and I should implement that in depth before trying to
 * work it through further with the stress tests.  Also, the Entry needs to be
 * generalized since the IObjectIndexEntry is not really supported as yet.
 * 
 * @todo Add stress test with periodic re-loading of the btree, tracking its
 *       expected state, and verifying that state.
 * 
 * @todo Support testing against each of the journal modes, at least for the
 *       integration test with the btree as the object index implementation for
 *       the journal.
