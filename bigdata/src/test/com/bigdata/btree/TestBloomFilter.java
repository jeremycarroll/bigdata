/**
 * Test suite for bloom filter functionality.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @see BloomFilter
 * 
 * @todo is a bloom filter efficient when the btree is backed by the journal or
 *       should it be moved to the client in that case?
 * 
 * @todo write logic that configures a bloom filter for a target error rate
 *       given the expected number of keys. since our use case is in front of a
 *       read-only {@link IndexSegment} we always know the #of keys exactly at
 *       the time that we provision the bloom filter. this makes it easy for us
 *       to tune the filter for a desired false positive rate.
 * 
 * @todo compare the heritrix and mg4j implementations with respect to
 *       optimizations and support for non-array types, e.g., int, long, double,
 *       etc. heritrix has done a lot of optimization for int32 vs int64
 *       platforms and also for very large bloom filters. our own use is for an
 *       {@link IndexSegment} of not more than 200M of data, so the size of the
 *       filter will be significantly smaller than that required by heritrix.
 * 
 * @todo develop and validate a binary serialization of the bloom filter for
 *       inclusion in the {@link IndexSegment}.
 * 
 * @todo estimate the parameters of a bloom filter to be deployed in front of an
 *       index segment and measure the cost of constructing that bloom filter
 *       and its space requirements.
 * 
 * @todo is there a method to report the #of bits that are on? once this exceeds
 *       a threshold the bloom filter begins to loose information and the error
 *       rate goes up.
 * 
 * @todo is there a way to report the effective error rate of the bloom filter?
