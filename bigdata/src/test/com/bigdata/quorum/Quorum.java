/**
 * A quorum is a collection of services instances comprising the same logical
 * service. The {@link Quorum} interface provides a view of the quorum from the
 * perspective of one of those member services. A quorum has a replication
 * factor <em>k</em>. A member service may "join" with a quorum when it shares
 * an agreement with at least (k+1)/2 other quorum members concerning its state.
 * When there are at least (k+1)/2 member services joined with the quorum, the
 * quorum is "meets" and elects a leader. Each time a new leader is elected, it
 * assigns a unique token to the quorum. Client reads and writes will block
 * unless the quorum is met. If a quorum breaks, then any outstanding writes
 * will be discarded and the client must wait until the quorum meets again
 * before reading or writing on the quorum.
 * <p>
 * The first service in the chain is the quorum <i>leader</i>. Client writes are
 * directed to the leader (also known as the master) and replicated to the
 * member services joined with the quorum. Clients may read from any service in
 * the quorum, but only for historical commit points. The current uncommitted
 * state is only available from the quorum leader as the followers are only
 * guaranteed to be consistent as of each commit point.
 * <p>
 * The services in the quorum are organized into a <em>write pipeline</em> for
 * the purposes of replication. The leader is always the first service in the
 * write pipeline. Services which are not yet joined with the quorum are allowed
 * into the write pipeline while they are synchronizing with the leader. When a
 * service is synchronized, it can then join the quorum.
 * <p>
 * This interface reflects state changes in the quorum for some logical service.
 * Logical services and their physical instances are managed outside of the
 * {@link Quorum} interface. When a physical service is starts or stops, it uses
 * a {@link Quorum} for the corresponding logical service to observe and manage
 * state changes in the emergent quorum of physical services for the same
 * logical service.
 * 
 * @todo There are three distinct needs for listeners: (1) Remote services that
 *       want to be informed about quorum state changes; (2) A service that is
 *       highly available and needs to take various actions in order to realize
 *       the semantics of quorum state changes; and (3) A process which monitors
 *       the shared quorum state (in zookeeper) and notifies either (1) or (2)
 *       of interesting events.
 * 
 * @todo The quorum api should make it possible for a client to watch the quorum
 *       state for another service or to rediscover the leader when the leader
 *       fails over (robust messaging). That will mean breaking up this
 *       interface into a facet for services monitoring a quorum and a facet for
 *       a service that is a member of that quorum. There are also a bunch of
 *       methods that are used solely by the quorum members to communicate with
 *       one another to manage their shared state (commit protocol, write
 *       replication, bad reads, synchronization, etc).
 * 
 * @todo When services join with a quorum they should validate their root blocks
 *       in detail.
 * 
 * @todo Consider hot spare allocation. When a hot spare is assigned to a
 *       quorum, the hot spare will be a quorum member and will join the write
 *       pipeline, but it will not yet be joined with the quorum. If the failed
 *       service comes back online and the quorum is once more at capacity, then
 *       the hot spare should be taken down by the same administrative
 *       monitoring which caused it to be allocated. That administrative
 *       monitoring needs to distinguish between the number of created instances
 *       of a service (something which we track in zookeeper for the SMS) and
 *       the #of join members of the quorum (also tracked in zookeeper, but this
 *       is a different value). Normally, the SMS will not allocate a new
 *       physical service instance once the replication count of the service has
 *       been satisfied, which is why this needs to happen in slightly different
 *       logic.
 *       <p>
 *       If we allow temporary overcapacity during the recruitment of a hot
 *       spare then we may have to closely review the definition of a member
 *       service which can vote and be counted in a quorum in order to avoid
 *       degrading the quorum by, essentially, having <i>k</i> as an even
 *       number. Perhaps a hot spare must <em>replace</em> a quorum member, in
 *       which case the other service must not be allowed back into the quorum
 *       once the hot spare has been assigned to the quorum. This would mean
 *       that the other service was disabled and/or destroyed before the hot
 *       spare was allocated.
 *       <p>
 *       Also related to hot spare allocation is support for planned downtime.
 *       Who has responsibility for ensuring that planned downtime for a node
 *       does not cause a quorum to break? Presumably we should not recruit a
 *       hot spare during planned downtime.
