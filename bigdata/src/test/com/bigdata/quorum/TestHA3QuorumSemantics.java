/**
 * Test the quorum semantics for a highly available quorum of 3 services. The
 * main points to test here are the particulars of events not observable with a
 * singleton quorum, including that all events are perceived by all clients via
 * the watcher for their quorum, that a service join which does not trigger a
 * quorum meet, that a service leave which does not trigger a quorum break, a
 * leader leave, etc.
 * <p>
 * These conditions arise because the quorum can meet with 2 out of 3 services
 * forming a consensus. Even if the third service has the same lastCommitTime,
 * if it votes after the other services, then it can be in the position of
 * joining a quorum which has already met. This leads naturally into an
 * exploration of the synchronization protocol for the persistent state of the
 * services when joining a met quorum.

 *          FIXME THere will need to be unit tests for synchronization when a
 *          service wants to join a met quorum.
