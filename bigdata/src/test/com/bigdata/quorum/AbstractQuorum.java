    /**
     * Base class for {@link QuorumActor} implementations. The methods on this
     * base class are designed maintain certain invariants in the distributed,
     * both for this service and (in the case of forcing a pipeline leave on
     * another service) for other services.
     * <p>
     * This class does NOT cause changes in the local {@link AbstractQuorum}
     * state directly. Instead, it makes changes to the distributed quorum state
     * which are perceived by the {@link QuorumWatcherBase}, which makes the
     * corresponding adjustments to the {@link AbstractQuorum}'s internal state.
     * <p>
     * Note: It is not possible in a distributed system to guarantee that state
     * changes made by other processes will not conflict with those which are
     * made by this actor on the behalf of its service. However, outside of rare
     * cases such as forcing another service to withdraw from the pipeline, all
     * services act solely on their own facet of the distributed quorum state
     * and all state changes are those which can be made atomic using a suitable
     * distributed state system, such as zookeeper.
     * 
     * <h3>Public API Implementation Notes</h3>
     * 
     * This base class implements the public API and delegates each public
     * method to a protected abstract method which must be implemented by the
     * concrete class. The public methods are final and encapsulate the logic to
     * maintain the invariants for the distributed quorum state. The abstract
     * protected methods must embody the logic required to effect those
     * distributed state changes. All such state changes MUST be atomic. Since
     * we will be invoking the public APIs for other operations, the public API
     * methods should only log messages if the actor will <em>do</em> something.
     * <p>
     * Everything is done while holding the {@link AbstractQuorum#lock}. Since
     * each service only acts on itself, the distributed state should remain
     * consistent. The {@link AbstractQuorum} and the {@link QuorumActorBase}
     * both <em>rely</em> on the {@link AbstractQuorum}s internal image of the
     * distributed quorum state, which is maintained by the
     * {@link QuorumWatcherBase}.
     * <p>
     * Note: For the zookeeper integration, a bad local image of the distributed
     * state can be corrected by closing the zookeeper connection. A new
     * connection will be automatically obtained and the local state image will
     * be reinitialized from the distributed quorum state as the
     * {@link QuorumWatcher} reestablishes its watchers.
     * 
     * <h4>Public API "Add" methods</h4>
     * 
     * The "add" methods are those operations which add something to the
     * distributed quorum state, such as adding a member service, adding a
     * service to the pipeline, casting a vote, or a service join.
     * <p>
     * The public API "add" methods follow a pattern which rejects operations if
     * the preconditions for the action are not met while holding the
     * {@link AbstractQuorum#lock}. For example, a service can not "join" unless
     * it is a member, has cast a vote, there is a consensus for that vote, and
     * the service is part of the pipeline. The detailed preconditions are
     * documented on the {@link QuorumActor}.
     * 
     * <h4>Public API "Remove" methods</h4>
     * 
     * The "remove" methods are those operations which retract something from
     * the distributed quorum state, such as a service leave, a pipeline leave,
     * withdrawing a vote cast by a member service, and removing a member
     * service from the quorum.
     * <p>
     * The public API "remove" methods follow a pattern which retracts any other
     * information which must be retracted as a precondition before the
     * specified retraction may be applied. These preconditions are evaluated
     * while holding the {@link AbstractQuorum#lock}. Likewise, the actions are
     * taken while holding that lock. Since the {@link QuorumWatcherBase} must
     * obtain the lock in order to update the {@link AbstractQuorum}'s internal
     * state, the internal state of the {@link AbstractQuorum} will not (in
     * general) update until after the public API method releases the lock (this
     * might not be true for the within JVM mock objects since the watcher can
     * run in the same thread as the actor).
     * <p>
     * For example, the public API member remove operation is implemented as
     * follows. If, while holding the lock, the service is a member, then the
     * operation delegates to each of the other public API methods to remove it
     * from the joined services, the pipeline, and withdraw its votes. Finally,
     * the public {@link #memberRemove()} method invokes the protected method
     * {@link #doMemberRemove()} method to actually remove the service from the
     * set of member services in the distributed quorum state.
     * <p>
     * The public API methods all use conditional logic to cut down on remote
     * operations if the {@link AbstractQuorum}'s internal state shows that the
     * service is not a member, not in the pipeline, has not cast a vote, etc.
