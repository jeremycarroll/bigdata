     * fraction of a second). You can see this in the timestamps of the logger.
     * <p>
     * The test terminates when the fixture tears down the AbstractQuorum's
     * internal watcher action service, which has a hung action. If the
     * WatcherActionService is also single-threaded, then this could clearly
     * lead to a deadlock since there would be no thread available to handle new
     * events.
     * <p>
     * It is awaiting the quorumBreak condition in
     * AbstractQuorumActor.clearToken(). This issue may be that we have two
     * distinct signals for quorumBreak versus quorumMeet which need to be
     * combined and then the various methods modified to also test the condition
     * variable. [I've made that change.]
     * <p>
     * It seems likely that either a concurrent watcherActionService -or- a
     * finite timeout would get the unit tests to pass. However, only the former
     * would work around a deadlock due to a stuck Condition.
     * <p>
     * Look again at what Condition is getting stuck and at the stress test in
     * {@link #main(String[])} for causes. [nhang=17, nerr=0, nrun=1000]. There
     * are several different causes, each of which clearly reflects a different
     * ordering of the events.
     * <p>
     * It maybe that we see the problem with a singleton quorum because there
     * are no other sources of events to kick the quorum into motion again once
     * it fails to join under the initial impetus.
     * <p>
     * The problem appears to stem from withdrawing the cast vote before the
