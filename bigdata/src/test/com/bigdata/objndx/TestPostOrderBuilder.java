/**
 * Test suite for efficient post-order rebuild of an index in an external index
 * segment.
 * 
 * @todo try building large indices, exporting them into index segments, and
 *       then verifying that the index segments have the correct data.
 * 
 * @todo The notion of merging multiple index segments requires a notion of
 *       which index segments are more recent or alternatively which values are
 *       more recent so that we can reconcile values for the same key. this is
 *       linked to how we will handle transactional isolation.
 * 
 * @todo Handle "delete" markers. For full transactional isolation we need to
 *       keep delete markers around until there are no more live transactions
 *       that could read the index entry. This suggests that we probably want to
 *       use the transaction timestamp rather than a version counter. Consider
 *       that a read by tx1 needs to check the index on the journal and then
 *       each index segment in turn in reverse historical order until an entry
 *       (potentially a delete marker) is found that is equal to or less than
 *       the timestamp of the committed state from which tx1 was born. This
 *       means that an index miss must test the journal and all live segments
 *       for that index (hence the use of bloom filters to filter out index
 *       misses). It also suggests that we should keep the timestamp as part of
 *       the key, except in the ground state index on the journal where the
 *       timestamp is the timestamp of the last commit of the journal. This
 *       probably will also address VLR TX that would span a freeze of the
 *       journal. We expunge the isolated index into a segment and do a merge
 *       when the transaction finally commits. We wind up doing the same
 *       validation and merge steps as when the isolation occurs within a more
 *       limited buffer, but in more of a batch fashion. This might work nicely
 *       if we buffer the isolatation index out to a certain size in memory and
 *       then start to spill it onto the journal. If fact, the hard reference
 *       queue already does this so we can just test to see if (a) anything has
 *       been written out from the isolation index; and (b) whether or not the
 *       journal was frozen since the isolation index was created.
 * 
 * Should the merge down should impose the transaction commit timestamp on the
 * items in the index?
