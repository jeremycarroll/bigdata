/**
 * Test suite for compacting merge of B+-Trees.
 * 
 * @todo write tests where the keys do not overlap (done).
 * 
 * @todo write tests where the keys overlap but there are no conflicts.
 * 
 * @todo write tests: merging a tree with itself, merging trees w/o deletion
 *       markers, merging trees w/ deletion markers, merging trees w/ age-based
 *       version expiration, merging trees with count-based version expiration.
 * 
 * @todo write tests where there are keys that conflict. conflicts need to be
 *       resolved according to some policy, and there are a variety of policies
 *       that could make sense for different applications, e.g., treat one of
 *       the btrees as more recent so that it overwrites the entry for the same
 *       key in the other btree or track timestamps and retain either the N most
 *       recent or all entries of more more than a given age. yet another
 *       approach is to resolve the conflict using some state-based mechanism
 *       and "merge" the values. conflict of necessity interacts with isolation
 *       since what we are looking at are write-write conflicts.
 * 
 * @todo another twist on the concept of a conflict is a "deleted" entry. this
 *       interacts a bit with the isolation mechanism, just like the resolution
 *       of conflicts interactions with isolation (delete is just another kind
 *       of write, so this is still a write-write conflict).
 * 
 * @todo write tests where the merged data exceed the target size constraints
 *       for the index partition and work through a split of the parition. once
 *       again, this interacts with transactional isolation.
