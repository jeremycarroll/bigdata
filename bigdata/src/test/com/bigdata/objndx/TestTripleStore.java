/**
 * A test for measuring the possible insert rate for a triple store based on a
 * journal and btree using a synthetic data generator.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The s:p:o of the statements can use random selection without replacement from
 * a class space, a property space, and a literal space. Those spaces can be
 * pre-populated such that we can insert up to ( #class * #prop * #value )
 * distinct statements if we select subjects from the class space, predicates
 * from the property space, and objects from the literal space and the class
 * space. However, we should also select objects from the class space, which
 * produces additional distinct statements. The literal space should be divided
 * into plain literals, literals with language tags, and typed literals. The
 * space of types are the predefined XSD types plus those defined by RDFS
 * (rdf:xml).
 * <p>
 * 
 * In order to test plain RDF insert, we do not need to do anything beyond this.
 * <p>
 * 
 * In order to test RDFS insert, there needs to be some ontology. This can be
 * introduced by creating a class hierarchy from the class space and a property
 * heirarchy from the property space. Such a hierarchy could be formed by either
 * by inserting or removing rdfs:subClassOf (or rdfs:subPropertyOf) assertions
 * from a fully connected matrix in the appropriate space.
 * <p>
 * 
 * @todo The term indices need to use a distinct suffix code so that the
 *       identifiers assigned by each index are unique.
 * 
 * @todo Develop an {@link IValueSerializer} for use on leaves of a statement
 *       index. This can use an efficient data structure for immutable strings,
 *       e.g., some kind of persistent string table, trie, etc., to store the
 *       lexical components of each value in each statement and a compact
 *       representation of each statement in terms of those components.
 * 
 * @todo compute the MB/sec rate at which this test runs and compare it with the
 *       maximum transfer rate for the journal without the btree and the maximum
 *       transfer rate to disk. this will tell us the overhead of the btree
 *       implementation.
 * 
 * @todo Try a variant in which we have metadata linking statements and terms
 *       together. In this case we would have to go back to the terms and update
 *       them to have metadata about the statement. it is a bit circular since
 *       we can not create the statement until we have the terms and we can not
 *       add the metadata to the terms until we have the statement.
 * 
 * @todo Note that a very interesting solution for RDF places all data into a
 *       statement index and then use block compression techniques to remove
 *       frequent terms, e.g., the repeated parts of the value. Also note that
 *       there will be no "value" for an rdf statement since existence is all.
 *       The key completely encodes the statement. So, another approach is to
 *       bit code the repeated substrings found within the key in each leaf. *
 *       This way the serialized key size reflects only the #of distinctions.
 * 
 * @todo add logic to parse from rio into the database.
 * 
 * @todo measure the effect of batching (absorbing and then sorting a batch and
 *       doing bulk inserts into the various indices). try this with and without
 *       bulk inserts and also try with just "perfect" index builds and
 *       compacting sort-merges (i.e., a bulk load that runs outside of the
 *       transaction mechanisms).
 * 
 * @todo I've been thinking about rdfs stores in the light of the work on
 *       bigdata. Transactional isolation for rdf is really quite simple. Since
 *       lexicons (uri, literal or bnode indices) do not (really) support
 *       deletion, the only acts are asserting and retracting statements. since
 *       a statement always merges with an existing statement, inserts never
 *       cause conflicts. Hence the only possible write-write conflict is a
 *       write-delete conflict. quads do not really make this more complex (or
 *       expensive) since merges only occur when there is a context match.
 *       however entailments can cause twists depending on how they are
 *       realized.
 * 
 * If we do a pure RDF layer (vs RDF over GOM over bigdata), then it seems that
 * we could simple use a statement index (no lexicons for URIs, etc). Normally
 * this inflates the index size since you have lots of duplicate strings, but we
 * could just use block compression to factor out those strings when we evict
 * index leaves to disk. Prefix compression of keys will already do great things
 * for removing repetitive strings from the index nodes and block compression
 * will get at the leftover redundancy.
 * 
 * So, one dead simple architecture is one index per access path (there is of
 * course some index reuse across the access paths) with the statements inline
 * in the index using prefix key compression and block compression to remove
 * redundancy. Inserts on this architecture would just send triples to the store
 * and the various indices would be maintained by the store itself. Those
 * indices could be load balanced in segments across a cluster.
 * 
 * Since a read that goes through to disk reads an entire leaf at a time, the
 * most obvious drawback that I see is caching for commonly used assertions, but
 * that is easy to implement with some cache invalidation mechanism coupled to
 * deletes.
 * 
 * I can also see how to realize very large bulk inserts outside of a
 * transactional context while handling concurrent transactions -- you just have
 * to reconcile as of the commit time of the bulk insert and you get to do that
 * using efficient compacting sort-merges of "perfect" bulk index segments. The
 * architecture would perform well on concurrent apstars style document loading
 * as well as what we might normally consider a bulk load (a few hundred
 * megabytes of data) within the normal transaction mechanisms, but if you
 * needed to ingest uniprot you would want to use a different technique :-)
 * outside of the normal transactional isolation mechanisms.
 * 
 * I'm not sure what the right solution is for entailments, e.g., truth
 * maintenance vs eager closure. Either way, you would definitely want to avoid
 * tuple at a time processing and batch things up so as to minimize the #of
 * index tests that you had to do. So, handling entailments and efficient joins
 * for high-level query languages would be the two places for more thought. And
 * there are little odd spots in RDF - handling bnodes, typed literals, and the
 * concept of a total sort order for the statement index.
 * 
 * @todo Note that the target platform will use a 200M journal extent and freeze
 *       the extent when it gets full, opening a new extent. Once a frozen
 *       journal contains committed state, we can evict the indices from the
 *       journal into perfect index range files. Reads then read through the
 *       live journal, any frozen journals that have not been evicted yet, and
 *       lastly the perfect index range segments on the disk. For the latter,
 *       the index nodes are buffered so that one read is require to get a leaf
 *       from the disk. Perfect index range segments get compacted from time to
 *       time. A bloom filter in front of an index range (or a segment of an
 *       index range) could reduce IOs further.
 * 
 * @todo test with the expected journal modes, e.g., direct buffered, once the
 *       page buffering feature is in place.
 * 
 * @todo a true bulk loader does not need transactional isolation and this class
 *       does not use transactional isolation. When using isolation there are
 *       two use cases - small documents where the differential indicies will be
 *       small (document sized) and very large loads where we need to use
 *       persistence capable differential indices and the load could even span
 *       more than one journal extent.
 * 
 * @todo What about BNodes? These need to get in here somewhere.... So does
 *       support for language tag literals and data type literals. XML (or other
 *       large value literals) will cause problems unless they are factored into
 *       large object references if we actually store values directly in the
 *       statement index.

             * 170k tps for the disk and direct buffer modes and close to 200k
             * tps for the transient store with a branching factor of 256. The
             * increase in performance may be due to lower memory allocation
