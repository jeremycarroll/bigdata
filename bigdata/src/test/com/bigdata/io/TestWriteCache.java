/**
 * Test suite for the {@link WriteCache}.
 * <p>
 * Note: This test suite uses the {@link DirectBufferPool} to allocate its
 * buffers. This reduces the likelihood that direct buffers will be leaked
 * across the unit tests. The tests are written defensively to release the
 * {@link ByteBuffer}s back to the {@link DirectBufferPool}.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo test concurrent readers and a single writer.
 * 
 * @todo Build out write cache service for WORM (serialize writes on the cache
 *       but the caller does not wait for the IO and readers are non-blocking).
 *       A pool of write cache instances should be used. Readers should check
 *       the current write cache and also each non-recycled write cache with
 *       writes on it in the pool. Write caches remain available to readers
 *       until they need to be recycled as the current write cache (the one
 *       servicing new writes). The write cache services needs to maintain a
 *       dirty list of write cache instances. A single thread will handle writes
 *       onto the disk. When the caller calls flush() on the write cache service
 *       it flush() the current write cache (if dirty) to the dirty list and
 *       then wait until the specific write cache instances now on the dirty
 *       list have been serviced (new writes MAY continue asynchronously).
 * 
 * @todo Build out write cache service for RW. The salient differences here is
 *       gathered writes on the store. Note that writers do not have more
 *       concurrency since that bit is still synchronized inside of
 *       {@link WriteCache#write(long, ByteBuffer)} and the {@link RWStore}
 *       serializes its allocation requests. Also, the gathering writes can
 *       combine and order records from the dirty write cache list for better
 *       efficiency. However, if it does this during flush(), then it should not
 *       combine records from write caches which are inside of the write cache
 *       set on which the flush() is waiting in order to ensure that flush() is
 *       service in a timely manner.
 * 
 * @todo The WORM (and RW) stores need to also establish a read-write lock to
 *       prevent changes in the file extent from causing corrupt data for
 *       concurrent read or write operations on the file.
 * 
 * @todo Next steps.
 *       <p>
 *       First I plan to modify IndexSegmentBuilder to use WriteCache over the
 *       output file without a leaf buffer which should reduce the IO for index
 *       segment builds by 50% and let us remove the IUpdateStore from the
 *       DiskOnlyStrategy.
 *       <p>
 *       I wonder if we can take this a step at a time without branching? The
 *       main danger point is when we allow readers (and a single write thread)
 *       to run concurrently on the store. We just need to MUTEX those
 *       conditions with file extension, and a read-write lock is exactly the
 *       tool for that job. We also need to explore whether or not (and if so,
 *       how) to queue disk reads for servicing. I would like to take a metrics
 *       based approach to that once we have concurrent readers. I expect that
 *       performance could be very good on a server grade IO bus such as the
 *       cluster machines. The SAS should already handle the reordering of
 *       concurrent reads. However, it is clear that the SATA (non-SCSI) bus is
 *       not as good at this, so maybe handling in s/w makes sense for non-SCSI
 *       disks?
