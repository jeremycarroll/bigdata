/**
 * An ordered collection of services. A quorum has a replication factor
 * <em>k</em> and is considered "met" only when the #of services in the quorum
 * is at least <code>(k + 1)/2</code>. Client reads and writes will block unless
 * the quorum is met.
 * <p>
 * The first service in the chain is the master. Client writes are directed to
 * the master and are streamed from service to service in the order specified by
 * the quorum. Clients may read from any service in the quorum.
 * <p>
 * If a quorum breaks, then a new quorum must be met before client operations
 * can proceed. The new quorum will have a distinct token from the old quorum.

     * The token for the quorum. Each met quorum has a unique token which
     * identifies the committed state on which the agreement was achieved for at
     * least <code>(k + 1)/2</code> services. While the quorum meets on an
     * agreement on the <em>lastCommitTime</em>, the quorum token reflects each
     * such distinct agreement which is achieved even when agreement is on the
     * same <i>lastCommitTime</i>.

     * never a legal quorum token. Likewise, the initial token before any quorum
     * has been met should be {@link #NO_QUORUM}.

     * catching up through resynchronization? (Probably not. Synchronization
     * with an existing quorum needs to be specified in detail, but probably
     * does not change the quorum token. However, this also implies that changes
     * in the write pipeline, etc. may occur without a corresponding change in
     * the quorum token and must be detected and handled without error. This
     * implies that we must test HA with k=5 in order to test a loss of a
     * service in the quorum membership which do not cause the quorum to break.)
