/**
 * Test suite for basic {@link Journal} operations.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * @todo tests of creating a new journal, including with bad properties.
 * 
 * @todo tests of opening an existing journal, including with incomplete writes
 *       of a root block.
 * 
 * @todo tests when the journal is very large. This is NOT the normal use case
 *       for bigdata, but one option for an embedded database. However, even an
 *       embedded database would normally use a read-optimized database segment
 *       paired with the journal.
 * 
 * @todo Do stress test with writes, reads, and deletes.
 * 
 * @todo tests of the exclusive lock mechanism during startup/shutdown (the
 *       advisory file locking mechanism). This is not used for the
 *       memory-mapped mode, but it is used for both "Direct" and "Disk" modes.
 * 
 * @todo test for correct detection of a "full" journal.
 * 
 * @todo test ability to extend the journal.
 * 
 * @todo test ability to compact and truncate the journal. Compaction moves
 *       slots from the end of the journal to fill holes earlier in the journal.
 *       Truncation chops off the tail. Compaction is done in order to
 *       facilitate truncation for a journal whose size requirements have
 *       decreased based on observed load characteristics.
 * 
 * @todo write tests for correct migration of committed records to a database.
 * 
 * @todo write tests for correct logical deletion of records no longer readable
 *       by any active transaction (they have been since updated or deleted by a
 *       committed transaction _and_ there is no transaction running that has a
 *       view of a historical consistent state in which that record version is
 *       visible).
