/**
 * Test suite for {@link Journal} initialization.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
 * @version $Id$
 * 
 * FIXME Work through basic operations for writing and committing a transaction
 * without concurrency support, then modify to add in concurrency.
 * 
 * FIXME Modify the tests to look for transactional isolation? Or write
 * different tests for that. The initial issue is testing transactional
 * isolation for the object index. I am thinking about _also_ supporting
 * operations outside of a transaction (for use as an embedded database), in
 * which case those need to be tested. The tests for transactional isolation
 * need to verify that write/delete operations in a transaction are NOT visible
 * outside of that transaction, whether in the "root" scope or in any other
 * transaction. Beyond that we get into testing with concurrent modifications by
 * different transactions and proving out the validation and commit logic, as
 * well as proving that transaction isolation begins as of the last committed
 * state when the transaction starts and that concurrent commits do NOT bleed
 * into visibility within uncommitted, still running transactions. We also have
 * to prove that abort does not leave anything lying around, both that would
 * break isolation (unlikely) or just junk that lies around unreclaimed on the
 * slots (or in the index nodes themselves).
 * 
 * @todo tests of creating a new journal, including with bad properties.
 * 
 * @todo tests of opening an existing journal, including with incomplete writes
 *       of a root block.
 * 
 * @todo tests when the journal is very large (NOT the normal use case for
 *       bigdata).
 * 
 * @todo tests of the exclusive lock mechanism during startup/shutdown (the
 *       advisory file locking mechanism). This is not used for the
 *       memory-mapped mode, but it is used for both "Direct" and "Disk" modes.
 * 
 * @todo test ability to extend the journal.
 * 
 * @todo test ability to compact and truncate the journal. Compaction moves
 *       slots from the end of the journal to fill holes earlier in the journal.
 *       Truncation chops off the tail. Compaction is done in order to
 *       facilitate truncation for a journal whose size requirements have
 *       decreased based on observed load characteristics.
 * 
 * @todo write tests for correct migration of committed records to a database.
 * 
 * @todo write tests for correct logical deletion of records no longer readable
 *       by any active transaction (they have been since updated or deleted by a
 *       committed transaction _and_ there is no transaction running that has a
 *       view of a historical consistent state in which that record version is
 *       visible).
