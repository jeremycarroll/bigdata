/**
 * Test suite for the {@link ConcurrentJournal}.
 * 
 * FIXME write more tests!
 * 
 * @todo write test cases that submit various kinds of operations and verify the
 *       correctness of those individual operations. refactor the services
 *       package to do this, including things such as the
 *       {@link RangeQueryIterator}. this will help to isolate the correctness
 *       of the data service "api", including concurrency of operations, from
 *       the {@link DataService}.
 * 
 * @todo do large #s of runs with a transient store where we test to verify that
 *       a random (small to modest) population of operations may be executed and
 *       the store shutdown without encountering a deadlock problem in the write
 *       service. An alternative to shutdown is to periodically let the write
 *       service become quiesent (by not submitting more tasks) and verify that
 *       the periodic group commit does not cause a deadlock. Another variant is
 *       to periodically invoke group commit from another thread at random
 *       intervals and verify that no entry timings result in deadlocks.
 * 
 * @todo run tests of transaction throughput using a number of models. E.g., a
 *       few large indices with a lot of small transactions vs a lot of small
 *       indices with small transactions vs a few large indices with moderate to
 *       large transactions. Also look out for transactions where the validation
 *       and merge on the unisolated index takes more than one group commit
 *       cycle and see how that effects the application.
 * 
 * @todo explore tests in which we flood the write service and make sure that
 *       group commits are occuring in a timely basis, that we are not starving
 *       the write service thread pool (by running group commit when sufficient
 *       writers are awaiting a commit), and explore whether the write service
 *       should use a blocking queue (fixing a maximum capacity).
 * 
 * @todo Modify the RDFS database to use concurrent operations when writing the
 *       statement indices (sort and batch insert).
 * 
 * @todo add a stress/correctness test that mixes unisolated and isolated
 *       operations. Note that isolated operations (transactions) during commit
 *       simply acquire the corresponding unisolated index(s) (the transaction
 *       commit itself is just an unisolated operation on one or more indices).
 * 
 * @todo verify that lots of concurrent {@link RegisterIndexTask}s and
 *       {@link DropIndexTask}s are not problematic (proper synchronization on
 *       the {@link Name2Addr} instance).
 * 
 * @todo Verify proper partial ordering over transaction schedules (runs tasks
 *       in parallel, uses exclusive locks for access to the same isolated index
 *       within the same transaction, and schedules their commits using a
 *       partial order based on the indices that were actually written on).
 *       <p>
 *       Verify that only the indices that were written on are used to establish
 *       the partial order, not any index from which the tx might have read.
 * 
 * @todo test writing on multiple isolated indices in the same transaction and
 *       concurrency control for that.
 * 
 * @todo test writing on multiple isolated indices in the different transactions
 *       and verify that no concurrency limits are imposed across transactions
 *       (only within transactions).
 * 
 * @todo show state-based validation for concurrent transactions on the same
 *       index that result in write-write conflicts.
 * 
 * @todo rewrite the {@link StressTestConcurrent} to use
 *       {@link #submit(AbstractTask)}.
 * 
 * @todo revisit the transaction test suites and update them to validate
 *       behaviors under concurrent operations.
