/**
 * Test suite for extensible hashing.
 * 
 * @todo Persistence capable hash table for high volume hash joins. The data
 *       will be "rows" in a "relation" modeled using binding sets. We can use
 *       dense encoding of these rows since they have a fixed schema (some
 *       columns may allow nulls). There should also be a relationship to how we
 *       encode these data for network IO.
 * 
 * @todo Extensible hashing:
 *       <p>
 *       - hash(byte[] key) -> IRaba page. Use IRaba for keys/values and key
 *       search.
 *       <p>
 *       - Split if overflows the bucket size (alternative is some versioning
 *       where the computed hash value indexes into a logical address which is
 *       then translated to an IRawStore address - does the RWStore help us out
 *       here?)
 *       <p>
 *       - Ring buffer to wire in hot nodes (but expect random touches).
 *       <p>
 *       - initially, no history (no versioning). just replace the record when
 *       it is evicted from the ring buffer.
 *       <p>
 *       What follows is a summary of an extensible hashing design for bigdata.
 *       This covers most aspects of the hash map design, but does not drill
 *       deeply into the question of scale-out hash maps. The immediate goal is
 *       to develop a hash map which can be used for a variety of tasks,
 *       primarily pertaining to analytic query as described above.
 *       <p>
 *       Extensible hashing is one form of dynamic hashing in which buckets are
 *       split or coalesced as necessary and in which the reorganization is
 *       performed on one bucket at a time.
 *       <p>
 *       Given a hash function h generating, e.g., int32 values where b is the
 *       #of bits in the hash code. At any point, we use 0 LTE i LTE b bits of
 *       that hash code as an index into a table of bucket addresses. The value
 *       of i will change as the #of buckets changes based on the scale of the
 *       data to be addressed.
 *       <p>
 *       Given a key K, the bucket address table is indexed with i bits of the
 *       hash code, h(K). The value at that index is the address of the hash
 *       bucket. However, several consecutive entries in the hash table may
 *       point to the same hash bucket (for example, the hash index may be
 *       created with i=4, which would give 16 index values but only one initial
 *       bucket). The bucket address table entries which map onto the same hash
 *       bucket will have a common bit length, which may be LTE [i]. This bit
 *       length is not stored in the bucket address table, but each bucket knows
 *       its bit length. Given a global bit length of [i] and a bucket bit
 *       length of [j], there will be 2^(i-j) bucket address table entries which
 *       point to the same bucket.
 *       <p>
 *       Hash table versioning can be easily implemented by: (a) a checkpoint
 *       record with the address of the bucket address table (which could be
 *       broken into a two level table comprised of 4k pages in order to make
 *       small updates faster); and (b) a store level policy such that we do not
 *       overwrite the modified records directly (though they may be recycled).
 *       This will give us the same consistent read behind behavior as the
 *       B+Tree.
 *       <p>
 *       The IIndex interface will need to be partitioned appropriately such
 *       that the IRangeScan interface is not part of the hash table indices (an
 *       isBTree() and isHashMap() method might be added).
 *       <p>
 *       While the same read-through views for shards should work with hash maps
 *       as work with B+Tree indices, a different scheme may be necessary to
 *       locate those shards and we might need to use int64 hash codes in
 *       scale-out or increase the page size (at least for the read-only hash
 *       segment files, which would also need a batch build operation). The
 *       AccessPath will also need to be updated to be aware of classes which do
 *       not support key-range scans, but only whole relation scans.
 *       <p>
 *       Locking on hash tables without versioning should be much simpler than
 *       locking on B+Trees since there is no hierarchy and more operations can
 *       proceed without blocking in parallel.
 *       <p>
 *       We can represent tuples (key,value pairs) in an IRaba data structure
 *       and reuse parts of the B+Tree infrastructure relating to compression of
 *       IRaba, key search, etc. In fact, we might use to lazy reordering notion
 *       from Monet DB cracking to only sort the keys in a bucket when it is
 *       persisted. This is also a good opportunity to tackling splitting the
 *       bucket if it overflows the target record size, e.g., 4k. We could throw
 *       out an exception if the sorted, serialized, and optionally compressed
 *       record exceeds the target record size and then split the bucket. All of
 *       this seems reasonable and we might be able to then back port those
 *       concepts into the B+Tree.
 *       <p>
 *       We need to estimate the #of tuples which will fit within the bucket. We
 *       can do this based on: (a) the byte length of the keys and values (key
 *       compression is not going to help out much for a hash index since the
 *       keys will be evenly distributed even if they are ordered within a
 *       bucket); (b) the known per tuple overhead and per bucket overhead; (c)
 *       an estimate of the compression ratio for raba encoding and record
 *       compression. This estimate could be used to proactively split a bucket
 *       before it is evicted. This is most critical before anything is evicted
 *       as we would otherwise have a single very large bucket. So, let's make
 *       this simple and split the bucket if the sum of the key + val bytes
 *       exceeds 120% of the target record size (4k, 8k, etc). The target page
 *       size can be a property of the hash index. [Note: There is an implicit
 *       limit on the size of a tuple with this approach. The alternative is to
 *       fix the #of tuples in the bucket and allow buckets to be of whatever
 *       size they are for the specific data in that bucket.]
 * 
 * @todo RWStore integration notes:
 *       <p>
 *       - RWStore with "temporary" quality. Creates the backing file lazily on
 *       eviction from the write service.
 *       <p>
 *       - RWStore with "RAM" only? (Can not exceed the #of allocated buffers or
 *       can, but then it might force paging out to swap?)
 *       <p>
 *       - RWStore with "RAM" mostly. Converts to disk backed if uses all those
 *       buffers. Possibly just give the WriteCacheService a bunch of write
 *       cache buffers (10-100) and have it evict to disk *lazily* rather than
 *       eagerly (when the #of free buffers is down to 20%).
 *       <p>
 *       - RWStore with memory mapped file? As I recall, the problem is that we
 *       can not guarantee extension or close of the file under Java. But some
 *       people seem to make this work...

    /**
     * Unit test based on example in
     * "External Memory Algorithms and Data Structures" by Vitter, page 239.
     * <p>
     * The assignment of keys to buckets in this example is based on the low
     * bits of the key. Initially, the global depth is <code>3</code> so only
     * the lower three bits are considered.
     * 
     * <pre>
     * 0   0
     * 1   1
     * 2   10
     * 3   11
     * 4   100
     * 5   101
     * 6   110
     * 7   111
     * </pre>
     * 
     * To setup the example, we insert the sequence {4, 23, 18, 10, 44, 32, 9}
     * into an extensible hashing algorithm using buckets with a capacity of
     * <code>3</code>. The keys and the values stored in the buckets are int32
     * values. Inserting this sequence of keys should yield a hash table with a
     * global depth <em>d</em> of <code>8</code> having 8 addresses and four
     * buckets arranged as follows.
     * 
     * <pre>
     * [000] -> (A) [k=2] {4, 44, 32}
     * [001] -> (C) [k=1] {23, 9}
     * [010] -> (B) [k=3] {18}
     * [011] -> (C)
     * [100] -> (A)
     * [101] -> (C)
     * [110] -> (D) [k=3] {10}
     * [111] -> (C)
     * </pre>
     * 
     * Where <em>k</em> is the local depth of a given bucket and the buckets are
     * labeled A, B, C, ... based on the order in which they are written on the
     * page in the example (which presumably is the order in which those buckets
     * were created, but I have not yet verified this).
     * <p>
     * Next, key <code>76</code> is inserted. Considering only the d=3 bits of
     * its hash code, this key would be inserted the address having bits
     * <code>100</code>, which is mapped onto bucket (A). This will cause bucket
     * (A) to be split into (A) and (D). The local depth of (A) is increased by
     * one to <code>k=3</code>. The local depth of (D) is the same as (A). The
     * hash table looks as follows after this split.
     * 
     * <pre>
     * [000] -> (A) [k=3] {32}
     * [001] -> (C) [k=1] {23, 9}
     * [010] -> (B) [k=3] {18}
     * [011] -> (C)
     * [100] -> (E) [k=4] {4, 44, 76}
     * [101] -> (C)
     * [110] -> (D) [k=3] {10}
     * [111] -> (C)
     * </pre>
     * 
     * Finally, key <code>20</code> is inserted, again into the block addressed
     * by address table entry <code>100</code>. This causes block (E) to be
     * split into two blocks (E) and (F) having local bits <code>k=4</code>. The
     * address table is doubled and the #of global bits is increased to
     * <code>d=4</code>. The hash table after this expansion looks as follows:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * [0000] -> (A) [k=3] {32}
     * [0001] -> (C) [k=1] {23, 9}
     * [0010] -> (B) [k=3] {18}
     * [0011] -> (C)
     * [0100] -> (E) [k=4] {4, 20}
     * [0101] -> (C)
     * [0110] -> (D) [k=3] {10}
     * [0111] -> (C)
     *  ---- extension ----
     * [1000] -> (A)
     * [1001] -> (C)
     * [1010] -> (B)
     * [1011] -> (C)
     * [1100] -> (F) [k=4] {44, 76}
     * [1101] -> (C)
     * [1110] -> (D)
     * [1111] -> (C)
     * </pre>
     * 
     * When the address space is extended, the original address table entries
     * remain at their given offsets into the new table. The new address table
     * entries are initialized from the same entry which would have been
     * addressed if we considered one less bit. For example, any hash code
     * ending in <code>000</code> used to index into the first entry in the
     * address table. After the address table is split, one more bit will be
     * considered in the hash code of the key. Therefore, the same key will
     * either be in the address table entry <code>0000</code> or the entry
     * <code>1000</code>. To keep everything consistent, the address table entry
     * for <code>1000</code> is therefore initialized from the address table
     * entry for <code>0000</code>. In practice, all you are doing is writing a
     * second copy of the original address table entries starting immediately
     * after the original address table entries.
     * <p>
     * Personally, I find this representation much easier to interpret. You can
     * see that the address table was simply duplicated and (E) was split into
     * two buckets. One remains (E) and continues to be addressed from the 1st
     * half of the address table. The other is (F) and is the only change in the
     * 2nd half of the address table.
