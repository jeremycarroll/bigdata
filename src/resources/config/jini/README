This directory contains the configuration for the various Jini services.

DO NOT attempt to start the Jini browser service from the bigdata
script.  The browser service requires a GUI.  An attempt to start
the browser from the bigdata script will cause the jini service
start to fail.

You can always install jini in the normal manner when logged in
with a GUI and then run the service browser from there.
