This presumes that you have successfully installed bigdata using the
'ant install' target.

In order to manage the bigdata run state you need to modify the
crontab so that it will automatically execute the @BIN_DIR@/bigdata
script once per minute, reading the desired run state from
@STATE_FILE@ each time.

You can destructively overwrite the @INSTALL_USER@ crontab on the
localhost using:

crontab @BIN_DIR@/crontab.user

YOU MUST DO THIS FOR EACH HOST IN THE CLUSTER WHICH WILL RUN A BIGDATA
SERVICE.

Next, edit @STATE_FILE@ and change the bigdata run state to 'start'.
If everything was configured correctly, the bigdata services will
soon start on all hosts in the cluster.  You can watch the progress
using 

tail -f @STATE_LOG@

Likewise, you can look for errors using:

tail -f @ERROR_LOG@

You can use list the discovered services using:

@BIN_DIR@/listServices.sh
