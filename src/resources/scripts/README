This directory contains some scripts which may be useful on a un*x platform.

bigdataenv
 
          The configuration file for the shell environment.  This MUST be modified
          to reflect the local installation.  The other scripts in this directory
          rely on this script to setup their environment.
 
bigdata   

		  An init.d style script with start, stop, status, destroy, etc. actions.
		  In order to start up bigdata on a cluster, this script must be executed
		  on each machine which will participate in the bigdata federation.  This
		  can be done in a variety of ways, including cron jobs, puppet, torque,
		  etc.

	start - Starts a bigdata services manager on the local host.  The services
			manager will discover services which are already running and will
			attempt to start any services which may run on the local host based
			on the current configuration.
			
	stop  - Stops the bigdata services manager and any services on the local host
			which it was managing.  Services which have been stopped may be restarted
			at a later time.
			
  destroy - Destroys the bigdata services manager and any services on the local
			host which it was manager together with their data.  This action will
			DESTROY any persistent data associated with those service(s). 

   status - Reports on the run state of the bigdata services manager on the local
   			host.

      hup - Sends a HUP signal to the services manager.  This will cause a configuration
            push (the configuration will be read from its file or URL and written into
            zookeeper) and may cause new services to be started based on the updated
            configuration.

bigdataup
bigdatadown 
bigdataprecond
bigdatasetup
          
          These scripts are invoked automatically by the bigdata script.

dumpZoo.sh

		  Dumps the zookeeper state onto stdout.
		  
counters.sh

          Starts an httpd instance which may be used to view historical or post-
          mortem performance counters or events logged by bigdata.
