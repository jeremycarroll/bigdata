This directory contains some sample configuration for a highly available
Journal.  The basic procedure is to edit the various configuration files,
make sure that zookeeper is up and running with a consistent configuration,
start the ClassServer on at least one machine.  Start the service registrar
on at least one machine (as configured by the locators).  Start the 
HAJournalServer instances on each machine.

HAJournal.env - A shell script containing sample configuration values. This
                is sourced by the various scripts.

HAJournal.config - A sample configuration file for the HAJournalServer.

classServer.sh - A shell script that will start the jini class server (for
                 downloadable code).
                 
lookupStarter.sh - A shell script that will start the jini service registrar.

HAJournalServer.sh - A shell script that will start the HAJournalServer.

log4j.properties - A default log4j configuration file for use by the bigdata
                   services.
				   
logging.properties - A default Java logging configuration.  This may be used
					 to control the log levels for jini/river, which uses
					 java logging rather than log4j.

policy.all - A default java permissions file.  This file grants ALL permissions.
			 You may specify a more rigorous security policy.
