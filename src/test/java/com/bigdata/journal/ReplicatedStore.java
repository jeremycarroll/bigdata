/**
 * FIXME I've outlined a re-design below.
 * 
 * <pre>
    - Media redundency

      - derive a constrained interface similar to the Channel for
        read/write.  The main additional constraint is that
        implementations should be able to take advantage of the
        append-only nature of the store for writes and perhaps have a
        custom extension for updating the root blocks, since that is
        the only non-append write.
      
        - provide a FileChannel implementation.  it just writes on the
          file channel.

        - provide a write cache implementation.  it should be based on
          the disk only strategy's write cache and provide
          asynchronous write behind to the delegate.  this is the only
          layer that should buffer writes and it is the only layer
          that should handle read through of its write cache.  in
          order to have asynchronous writes there should be multiple
          buffers.  only one buffer is actively recieving writes while
          the other buffers are providing a read-behind cache (until
          they are reused) and an asynchronous write-behind to the
          delegate.

    - provide a network socket implementation (client and
          server). synchronous read/write on a network socket.  only
          the write facet is required for media redundency.  the
          read+write design would allow us to write on a remote
          service.  the client should have a single thread handling
          writes on the socket. the server should be single threaded
          using NIO.

    - provide a tee (writes on two delegates, reads from one).
          this will be used to write on both a local FileChannel and a
          remote store via a network socket.  it could also be used to
          write on two FileChannels for live redundency of the
          journal.

    - provide a memory only implementation based on the Transient
          buffer strategy.

    - The stacked set would look like this when used for media
          redundency.

      IRawStore>WriteCache>Tee>(NetworkChannel+FileChannel)

      Alternative stacks would handle a purely transient model
      with media redundency.

      IRawStore>WriteCache>Tee>(NetworkChannel+MemoryChannel)

      or without

      IRawStore>MemoryChannel
      
      
   There must also be support for replication of the secondary resources for
   an index partition (the index segments).
 * </pre>
 * 
 * A class that intercepts writes on an {@link IRawStore} and causes the written
 * record to be replicated on one or more remote store(s). Writes are replicated
 * asynchronously to minimize latency for the caller.
 * <p>
 * {@link #force(boolean)} will not return until the writes have been forced to
 * each of the remote store(s). This means that read committed requests may be
 * directed to either the local store or to any remote store that replicates
 * this local store. However, uncommitted writes are NOT guarenteed to be
 * available for reads at the remote stores until the next
 * {@link #force(boolean)}.
 * <p>
 * This class is responsible for streaming writes to the primary remote store,
 * which is the first remote store in an ordered list of remote stores. The
 * primary is then responsible for replicating those writes to the secondary
 * remote store (if any). In turn, the secondary remote store will replicate the
 * write to its downstream remote store (if any), and so on.
 * <p>
 * If the primary remote store fails or is taken out of service, then this class
 * will promote the secondary remote store to become the new primary remote
 * store and will ensure that the secondary remote store is up to date no later
 * than the next {@link #force(boolean)}.
 * <p>
 * If the number of replicated instances of the local store falls below a target
 * replication count then a new remote store will be discovered and added to the
 * replication chain.
 * 
 * FIXME IRawStore is not the best way to integrate this. We need to integrate
 * at a level that exposes the [nextOffset], write(), commit(), force(),
 * abort(), close(), and closeAndDelete() notices.
 * <p>
 * Also, since we are not sending along addresses paired with individual records
 * we need the ability on the replicated store to write directly on the backing
 * file or buffer rather than on any write cache.
