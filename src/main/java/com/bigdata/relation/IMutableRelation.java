/**
 * A mutable {@link IRelation}. The relation must maintain any secondary
 * indices under mutation.
 * <p>
 * The methods declared by this interface return a "mutation count" - the
 * mutation count MUST be exact and MUST NOT count overwrites that do not change
 * the state of the tuple (the same key and value). The mutation counts are used
 * to determine the fixed point for closure of a rule set. If they do not follow
 * this contract then the closure operation will not terminate!
 * <p>
 * If fact, it is MUCH more efficient if an implementation avoids the overwrite
 * of an element with identical data. All index writes (including overwrites)
 * add data to the {@link AbstractJournal} backing the mutable {@link BTree}
 * absorbing writes for an index. An "overwrite" thus incurs more IO and will
 * trigger overflow for the journal earlier than if overwrite were avoided. In
 * contrast, while you have a lock on the mutable index you can test for a
 * pre-existing key and compare the serialized byte[] values with relatively
 * little cost (zero additional IO).

     * changes will not be atomic unless you use a full transaction or
     * read-behind from a last known consistent commit point.
