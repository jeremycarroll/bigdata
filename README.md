# BigData¨

The main page for BigData¨ is at [bigdata.com](http://www.bigdata.com/bigdata/blog/).
The source repository is at [sourecforge](http://www.sf.net/projects/bigdata).

This is the Syapse copy of the code, and should not be further forked.
We use this copy as:
* a scratchpad for work in progress that we merge into the main code base as agreed with the bigdata¨ team
* the deploy branch is the version of the code we actually use (decoupled from the release cycles of the main project)

## Acknowledgement

We thank the Systap team for their help with bigdata¨.

Jeremy Carroll thanks [YourKit](http://www.yourkit.com) for Java profiling support.
