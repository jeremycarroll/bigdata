    /**
     * There are two distinct commit protocols depending on whether the
     * transaction write set is distributed across more than one
     * {@link IDataService}. When write set of the transaction lies entirely on
     * a single {@link IDataService}, an optimized commit protocol is used.
     * When the write set of the transaction is distributed, a 3-phase commit is
     * used with most of the work occurring during the "prepare" phase and a
     * very rapid "commit" phase. If a distributed commit fails, even during the
     * "commit", then the transaction will be rolled back on all participating
     * {@link IDataService}s.
     * 
     * <h3>Single phase commits</h3>
     * 
     * A simple commit protocol is used when the write set of the transaction
     * resides entirely on a single {@link IDataService}. Such commits DO NOT
     * contend for named resource locks (either on the index names or on the
     * {@link IDataService} {@link UUID}s). Since such transactions DO NOT have
     * dependencies outside of the specific {@link IDataService}, a necessary
     * and sufficient partial order will be imposed on the executing tasks
     * locally by the {@link IDataService} on which they are executing based
     * solely on the named resources which they declare. Without dependencies on
     * distributed resources, this can not deadlock.
     * 
     * <h3>Distributed commits</h3>
     * 
     * Transaction commits for a distributed database MUST be prepared in a
     * partial order so that they do not deadlock when acquiring the necessary
     * locks on the named indices on the local data services. That partial order
     * is imposed using the {@link #indexLockManager}. The named index locks
     * are pre-declared at the start of the distributed commit protocol and are
     * held through both the prepare and commit phases until the end of the
     * commit protocol. The distributed commit must obtain a lock on all of the
     * necessary named index resources before proceeding. If there is an
     * existing commit using some of those resources, then any concurrent commit
     * requiring any of those resources will block. The {@link LockManager} is
     * configured to require pre-declaration of locks. Deadlocks are NOT
     * possible when the locks are pre-declared.
     * <p>
     * A secondary partial ordering is established based on the
     * {@link IDataService} {@link UUID}s during the commit phase. This partial
     * order is necessary to avoid deadlocks for concurrently executing commit
     * phases of distributed transactions that DO NOT share named index locks.
     * Without a partial order over the participating {@link IDataService}s,
     * deadlocks could arise because each transaction will grab an exclusive
     * lock on the write service for each participating {@link IDataService}.
     * By ordering those lock requests, we again ensure that deadlocks can not
     * occur.
     * <p>
     * Note: The prepare phase for distributed commits allows the maximum
     * possible concurrency. This is especially important as validation and
     * merging down onto the unisolated indices can have significant length for
     * large transactions.
     * <p>
     * The commit phase should be very fast, with syncing the disk providing the
     * primary source of latency. All participating indices on the participating
     * data services have already been checkpointed. Once the commitTime is
     * assigned by the {@link DistributedTransactionService}, the group commit
     * need only update the root block on the live journal and sync to disk.
     * 
     * @todo Place timeout on the commit phase where the tx will abort unless
     *       all participants join at the "committed" barrier within ~ 250ms.
     *       That should be a generous timeout, but track aborts for this reason
     *       specifically since they may indicate interesting problems (heavy
     *       swapping, network issues, etc).
     * 
     * @todo make sure that we checkpoint the commit record index and
     *       {@link Name2Addr} before requesting the commitTime to remove even
     *       more latency.

         * Note: read-write transactions that have written on multiple journals
         * must use a distributed (2-/3-phase) commit protocol. As part of the
         * commit protocol, we obtain an exclusive write lock on each journal on
         * which the transaction has written. This is necessary in order for the
         * transaction as a whole to be assigned a single commit time. Latency
         * is critical in this commit protocol since the journals participating
         * in the commit will be unable to perform any unisolated operations
         * until the transaction either commits or aborts.
         * <p>
         * Note: There is an assumption that the revisionTime does not need to
         * be the commitTime. This allows us to get all the heavy work done
         * before we reach the "prepared" barrier, which means that the commit
         * phase should be very fast. The assumption is that validation of
         * different transactions writing on the same unisolated indices is in
         * fact serialized. The transaction services MUST enforce that
         * assumption by serializing distributed commits (at least those which
         * touch the same index partitions (necessary constraint), the same
         * indices (sufficient constraint) or the same {@link IDataService}s
         * (sufficient constraint)). If it did not serialize distributed commits
         * then <strong>deadlocks</strong> could arise where two distributed
         * commits were each seeking the exclusive write lock on resources, one
         * of which was already held by the other commit.

     * @todo Is it a problem if the commit notices do not arrive in sequence?
     *       Because they will not. Unisolated operations will participate in
     *       group commits using timestamps obtained from the transaction
     *       service, but those commit operations will not be serialize and
     *       their reporting of the timestamps for the commits will likewise not
     *       be serialized.
     *       <p>
     *       The danger is that we could assign a read-historical transaction
     *       start time based on the {@link #commitTimeIndex} and then have
     *       commit timestamps arrive that are within the interval in which we
     *       made the assignment. Essentially, our interval was too large and
     *       the assigned start time may have been on either side of a
     *       concurrent commit. However, this can only occur for unisolated
     *       operations (non-transactional commits). The selected timestamp will
     *       always be coherent with respect to transaction commits since those
     *       are coordinated and use a shared commit time.
     *       <p>
     *       This issue can only arise when requesting historical reads for
     *       timestamps that are "close" to the most recent commit point since
     *       the latency involve would otherwise not effect the assignment of
     *       transaction start times. However, it can occur either when
     *       specifying the symbolic constant {@link ITx#READ_COMMITTED} to
     *       {@link #newTx(long)} or when specifying the exact commitTime
     *       reported by a transaction commit.
     *       <p>
     *       Simply stated, there is NO protection against concurrently
     *       unisolated operations committing. If such operations are used on
     *       the same indices as transactions, then it IS possible that the
     *       application will be unable to read from exactly the post-commit
     *       state of the transaction for a brief period (10s of milliseconds)
     *       until the unisolated commit notices have been propagated to the
     *       {@link DistributedTransactionService}. This issue will only occur
     *       when there is also a lot of contention for reading on the desired
     *       timestamp since otherwise the commitTime itself may be used as a
     *       transaction start time.
     * 
     * @todo depending on the latency involved and the issue described
     *       immediately above, it might be possible to simply queue these
     *       notices and consume them in an async thread. some operations (such
     *       as a distributed commit) might require that we catch up on the
