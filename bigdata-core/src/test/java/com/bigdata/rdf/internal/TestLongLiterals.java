/**
 * Above a configured size, long literals are transparently promoted to blobs.
 * When a long literal is recognized, a hash code is computed from the literal
 * using the configured cryptographic hash function. That hash code serves as
 * the key in the TERM2ID index. The TERM2ID index assigns a term identifier,
 * just as it always does. The ID2TERM index stores the mapping from the term
 * identifier onto a blob reference for the long literal. The blob reference is
 * stored on the journal associated with the ID2TERM index / shard. On overflow,
 * the blob is copied into an index segment as part of the shard build and the
 * blob reference is updated by the {@link IOverflowHandler} so that it will now
 * resolve the blob against the index segment rather than the journal.
 * 
 * FIXME Finish long literal support, including unit tests.
 * 
 * @todo It would be nice to send the hash code rather than the literal to the
 *       TERM2ID index to avoid the overhead of sending the long literal to both
 *       the TERM2ID and ID2TERM indices.
 * 
 * @todo Above some size we need to use a hash function of the literal as the
 *       key. The literal itself will be stored in a raw record on the journal.
 *       The TERM2ID index would map the hash code of the literal onto a blob
 *       reference. The blob reference will be linked to the TERM2ID shard and
 *       will migrate naturally to an index segment on overflow. The ID2TERM
 *       index will not store the reverse mapping. Instead, the blob reference
 *       is de-referenced against the TERM2ID index. The blob reference can
 *       appear inline in the statement indices [this suggests that we need to
 *       extend from one byte to two bytes for the header.]
 *       <p>
 *       The blob reference will need the identity of the index partition
 *       against which it must be resolved. The easiest way to do this is to
 *       encode the hash code of the literal into the blob reference together
 *       with the address of the raw record for that blob. No, that does not
 *       work since the raw address needs to be updated during overflow. So we
 *       have to generate a term identifier for the literal, resolve the term
 *       identifier to a blob reference using ID2TERM, and store the raw record
 *       with the ID2TERm shards.
 *       <p>
 *       See the {@link BigdataFileSystem} for a blob reference implementation.
 *       <p>
 *       We need to use a hash function which has a low probability of
 *       collisions. E.g., MD5 or better (MD5 can be spoofed another
 *       cryptographic hash function might be better).
