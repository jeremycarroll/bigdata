This directory contains queries for data published by GovTrack [1] in RDF [2]. 
These data are used with permission per the license [3].  A snapshot [4] of 
data was taken in March, 2010, and is available for download. In order to
provide stable basis for CI, the snapshot is used when running the queries
against these data.

The trig directory in the govtrack.zip file are those triples from [2], placed
into named graphs by Cambridge Semantics.  The additions directory are additional
quads inferred by Cambridge Semantics in order to have more complete rdf:type 
statements.  See the background directory for more information on this process.
