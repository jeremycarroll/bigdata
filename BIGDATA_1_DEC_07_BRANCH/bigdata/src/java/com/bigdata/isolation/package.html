<title>B+Tree Isolation Support</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
A B+-Tree designed to support transactional isolation.  This builds on the features
of the base B+-Tree package, which already supports copy-on-write semantics, and on
the Journal package, which already supports a policy in which valid data are never
overwritten.  The primary contribution of this package is a set of extensions and
wrapper classes that manage {@link IValue} objects wrapping application data values.
Each {@link IValue} encapsulates a version counter, which is used to detect write-write
conflicts, and a deleted flag, which is used to mark keys that have been deleted until
a full compacting merge can be performed.
