/**
 * <p>
 * A scalable mutable B+-Tree mapping variable length unsigned byte[] keys to
 * byte[] values that is capable of being isolated by a transaction and supports
 * deletion markers. Application values are transparently encapsulated in
 * {@link IValue} object which keep track of version counters (in support of
 * transactions) and deletion markers (in support of both transactions and
 * partitioned indices). Users of this interface will only see application
 * values, not {@link IValue} objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that {@link #rangeCount(byte[], byte[])} MAY report more entries than
 * would actually be visited. This is because it depends on
 * {@link #indexOf(byte[])} and the internal counts of the #of spanned entries
 * for a node do not differentiate between entries which have and have not been
 * {@link IValue#isDeleted() deleted}.

 * 
 * @see UnisolatedIndexSegment, a read-only {@link IndexSegment} suitable for

 * The following is an ad-hoc summary of the behavior of some methods exposed by
 * this class:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  
 *  contains() - done.
 *  insert() - done.
 *  remove() - done.
 *  lookup() - done.
 *  
 *  addAll() - ok as implemented.  values will be wrapped in {@link IValue} objects
 *  as they are inserted.  if the source is also an {@link UnisolatedBTree} then the
 *  application values will be inserted into this tree, not the {@link IValue} objects.
 *  
 *  removeAll() - override to write deletion markers for each entry.
 *  
 *  indexOf() - ok as implemented (counts deleted entries).
 *  keyAt() - ok as implemented, but will return keys for deleted entries.
 *  valueAt() - overriden to return null for a deleted entry.
 *  
 *  rangeCount - ok as implemented (counts deleted entries).
 *  rangeIterator - must filter out deleted entries.
 *  
 *  entryIterator() - only non-deleted entries.
 *  
 *  IBatchBTree - all methods are overriden to use {@link IBatchOperation#apply(ISimpleBTree)}
 *  so that they will correctly apply the semantics of the {@link UnisolatedBTree}.
 *  
 * </pre>
 * 
 * @todo Any changes to the non-mutation operations on this class MUST also be
