# I have experienced problems under Windows with Maven failing to
# consistently locate the ~/buid.properties file, e.g., within a
# multiproject build or other sub-process execution context.  If you
# have the same problem, then you can always explicitly declare the
# properties on the maven command line, e.g., using a batch script or
# cygwin alias....

# The various sub-projects are organized by the "bigdata-master-pom" umbrella
# project.  Since these projects are siblings and not children of the
# "bigdata-master-pom" project, you MUST to override the "multiproject" plugin to
# locate the sub-projects by setting "maven.multiproject.basedir" to
# the directory ABOVE the individual projects.

maven.multiproject.excludes=bigdata-master-pom/project.xml
maven.multiproject.includes=*/project.xml

# This is the default host for CVS.  However, if you are running on
# the SourceForge shell server, then the host name is "cvs1".  You
# should override this property in ~/build.properties.  (On Windows
# this will probably be in "C:\Documents And Settings\{username}\".
