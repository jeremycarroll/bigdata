     * FIXME The NSS should transparently proxy mutation requests to the quorum
     * leader (and to a global leader if offsite is supported, or maybe that is
     * handled at a layer above). The tests need to be modified (A) to NOT only
     * write on the leader; and (B) to verify that we can send a write request
     * to ANY service that is joined with the met quorum. (And verify for POST,
     * DELETE, and PUT since those are all different method.)
     * <p>
     * Note: We could have services that are not joined with the met quorum
     * simply forward read requests to services that ARE joined with the met
     * quorum. That way they can begin "accepting" reads and writes immediately.
     * This could also be done one level down, using failover reads to reach a
     * service joined with the met quorum.
