/**
 * Test suites for an {@link HAJournalServer} quorum with a replication factor
 * of THREE (3) and a fully met {@link Quorum}.
 * 
 * FIXME (***) We need unit tests where we fail (shutdown) the service in at the head
 * of the pipeline (the leader), the 2nd position, and the last position. We
 * need to make sure that the quorum remains (when failing a follower) and that
 * it re-meets (when failing a leader). We also need to extend these tests to
 * verify that the service that was failed can be restarted. And we need to have
 * versions of these tests that bounce the service rather than shutting it down
 * and then restarting it.
 * 
 * FIXME (***) We need unit tests that focus on resynchronization (writes were missed
 * during a service shutdown or bounce and hence the service must synchronize
 * when it comes back up).
 * 
 * FIXME We need unit tests that focus on rebuild (disaster recovery).
 * 
 * TODO We can do an explicit service restart or we can tell a service to bounce
 * its zk connection. Both will force a service leave and pipeline leave. The
 * shutdown/restart tests service restart while the zk bounce tests the impact
 * of a GC causing a timeout or a cured network partition.
 * 
 * TODO Tests to make sure that bouncing services rejoin and resync.
 * 
 * FIXME ---- HA3 RESYNC TESTS ----
 * 
 * TODO We need to verify that the HALog files are generated, that they are
 * identical, that they are retained while the quorum is not fully met, and that
 * they are removed when we go through a 2-phase commit with a fully met quorum.
 * 
 * TODO 2 services start in known order and the quourm meets. Write one or more
 * write sets on the leader and commit for each write set (the KB create is one
 * write set, a LOAD would be a second write set giving us 2 commit points).
 * Start 3rd service. The third service should resynchronize each historical
 * commit point from the HALog files on the leader and then join the met quorum.
 * Note: For this test, the leader is not receiving writes during the
 * resynchronization protocol.
 * 
 * Once the quorum is fully met, verify that all journals are 100% equals on the
 * disk. Note: The HALog files will not be purged since we only do that at a
 * fully met quorum commit, and while the 3rd service joined the quourm the
 * fully met quorum has not yet gone through a commit. (It is possible to delete
 * the logs when the quorum becomes fully met, rather than only when we go
 * through a fully met commit. The current behavior is more paranoid.)
 * 
 * TODO 2 services start in known order. The quorum meets. Begin a long running
 * LOAD on the leader. While that LOAD is running, start the 3rd service. The
 * service should resynchronize the historical commit points and "catch up" to
 * the live writes on the current write set and then join the quourm. The quorum
 * should be fully met when the LOAD is done and the HALog files should be
 * purged.
 * 
 * Note: In order to guarantee that the LOAD operation does not terminate before
 * we are resynchronized, we either need to LOAD a sufficiently large file or we
 * need to stream data to the leader. I think we should go with a large file.
 * 
 * TODO Verify that resync is chosen over rebuild when the HA Logs have been
 * purged at some point in the past but all necessary HALog files remain for the
 * resync operation (possible fence post - I have observed a rebuild operation
 * initiated when a resync was possible).
