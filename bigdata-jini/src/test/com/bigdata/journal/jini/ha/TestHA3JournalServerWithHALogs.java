     * This is a unit test for the ability to silently remove a logically empty
     * HALog file. Three services are started in sequence (A,B,C). A series of
     * small commits are applied to the quorum. (C) is then shutdown. A
     * logically empty HALog file should exist on each service for the next
     * commit point. However, since this might have been removed on C when it
     * was shutdown, we copy the logically empty HALog file from (A) to (C). We
     * then do one more update. C is then restarted. We verify that C restarts
     * and that the logically empty HALog file has been replaced by an HALog
     * file that has the same digest as the HALog file for that commit point on
     * (A,B).
     * <p>
     * Note: We can not reliably observe that the logically HALog file was
     * removed during startup. However, this is not critical. What is critical
     * is that the logically empty HALog file (a) does not prevent (C) from
     * starting; (b) is replaced by the correct HALog data from the quorum
     * leader; and (c) that (C) resynchronizes with the met quorum and joins
     * causing a fully met quorum.
