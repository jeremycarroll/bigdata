/**
 * Test suite for concurrent operations on a {@link DataService}. A federation
 * consisting of a {@link MetadataService} and a single {@link DataService} is
 * started. A client is created, connects to the federation, and registers an
 * index the federation. A pool of threads is created for that client and
 * populated with a number of operations. The threads then write and read
 * concurrently using unisolated operations on the data services. This test can
 * be used to observe the throughput and queue depth of arising from a variety
 * of data service and client configurations.
 * 
 * @todo I have observed better performance with the {@link BufferMode#Disk}
 *       when compared to {@link BufferMode#Direct}. I expect that this is due
 *       to resource starvation on a laptop class platform. The fully buffered
 *       mode should be faster if there are sufficent resources available (its
 *       main advantage occurs during overflow since that operation requires
 *       reads against partly random locations in the journal to build up the
 *       index segments). (The problem is also that we are not IO bound - the
 *       btree search and node/leaf serialization are the main bottlenecks.)
 * 
 * @todo The primary metrics reported by the test are elapsed time and
 *       operations per second. Compute the through put in terms of bytes per
 *       second for writes. This is interesting since it allows us to compare
 *       the effect of batch size on writes. Add parameterization for read vs
 *       write vs remove so that we can test the effect of batch size for
 *       operation profiles based on each of those kinds of operations.
 * 
 * @todo This test uses one index and one partition on one data service. Expand
 *       the test to test with multiple partitions on the same data service
 *       (concurrent writes on those partitions should be supported), with
 *       multiple indices (again, concurrent writes should be supported), and
 *       (possibly) with multiple data services.
 * 
 * @todo measure the time in the RPC calls, including marshalling and
 *       unmarshalling of the arguments, and use those measurements to guide
 *       performance tuning. This can be done by comparing an embedded data
 *       service (no RPC) with a data service connected by JINI (RPC).
 * 
 * @todo Test w/ group commit and various group sizes.
 * 
 * @todo get the comparison support working. Parameterize the
 *       {@link DataService} configuration from the test suite so that we can
 *       test Disk vs Direct, forceCommit=No vs default, and other properties
 *       that might have interesting effects. These things can be directly
 *       manipulated in the mean time by editing the DataServer0.properties
 *       file.
