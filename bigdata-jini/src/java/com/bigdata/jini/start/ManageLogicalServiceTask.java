/**
 * Task makes adjusts an imbalance between the serviceCount and the #of logical
 * services (creating or destroying a logical service) and then exits.
 * 
 * @todo If the task hangs then the {@link ZLock} must be broken so that another
 *       service can give it a go.
 * 
 * @todo for create, all watches on the {@link ServiceConfiguration} znode must
 *       now set a watcher to maintain the logical service replication count by
 *       starting and stopping physical services as necessary.
 *       <p>
 * @todo lots for destroy, but also release any watches.
 * 
 * @todo No mechanism is currently defined to reduce the #of logical services
 *       and there are a variety of issues to be considered.
 *       <p>
 *       For example, if the target logical data service count is reduced below
 *       the actual #of logical data services then we need to identify a logical
 *       data service to shutdown (probably one that is lightly used) and shed
 *       all index partitions for that data service before it is shutdown,
 *       otherwise the data would be lost.
 *       <p>
 *       However, some kinds of services do not pose any such problem. For
 *       example, it should be trivial to reduce the #of jini registrars that
 *       are running or the #of {@link ClassServer}s.
 *       <p>
 *       In order to destroy a logical service, first set the #of replicas to
 *       zero so that the physical instances will be destroyed (using the
 *       {@link RemoteDestroyAdmin} and any other APIs required to insure that
 *       the total system state is preserved). Then delete the logical service
 *       node.
 * 
 * @todo Make sure the {@link MetadataService}, the LBS, and the transaction
 *       server DO NOT allow more than one logical instance in a federation.
 *       they can (eventually) have failover instances, but not peers. The
 *       {@link DataService} may be the only one that already supports "peers".
