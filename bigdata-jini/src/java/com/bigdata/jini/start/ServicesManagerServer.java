/**
 * A class for bootstrapping a {@link JiniFederation} across a cluster based on
 * a {@link Configuration} file describing some basic configuration parameters
 * and dynamically managing service discovery using <code>jini</code> and
 * master election and other distributed decision making using
 * <code>zookeeper</code>.
 * <p>
 * Each host runs <em>ONE (1)</em> of this server. The server will start other
 * processes on the local host, including: jini, zookeeper, an httpd service for
 * the RMI CODEBASE, and instances of the various services required by an
 * {@link IBigdataFederation}. Those decisions are based on configuration
 * requirements stored in zookeeper, including the target #of logical services
 * of some service type, the replication count for a logical service, and
 * {@link IServiceConstraint} that are used to decide which host will start the
 * new service. Zookeeper service instances are handled somewhat specially.
 * During startup, this server will start a zookeeper instance if one was
 * configured to run on this host and none is found to be running at that time.
 * <p>
 * The initial configuration for the federation is specified in a
 * {@link Configuration} file. That file is best located on a shared volume or
 * volume image replicated on the hosts in the cluster, along with the various
 * dependencies required to start and run the federation (java, jini, bigdata,
 * log4j configuration, related JARs, etc). The {@link Configuration} is used to
 * discover and/or start jini and zookeeper instance(s). Once zookeeper can be
 * discovered (using its own protocol, not jini), {@link ServicesManagerServer}
 * instances will contend for a lock on a node corresponding to the
 * {@link IBigdataFederation} described in the {@link Configuration}. If the
 * node is empty, then it will be populated with the initial configuration by
 * whichever process holds the lock, which is why it is important that all hosts
 * running this class are use an identical {@link Configuration}. Thereafter,
 * zookeeper will be used to manage the services in the federation.
 * <p>
 * Once running, the {@link ServicesManagerServer} will watch the zookeeper
 * nodes for the various kinds of services and will start or stop services as
 * the state of those nodes changes.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Destroying an arbitrary service instance is dangerous - if it is not
 * replicated then you can loose all your data!</strong>. In order to shutdown
 * a bigdata service instance use {@link RemoteDestroyAdmin#shutdown()} or zap
 * it from the command line (not the preferred approach, but that will only take
 * the service down, but not destroy its data). However, if the federation is
 * now undercapacity for that service type (or under the replication count for a
 * service instance), then a new instance will simply be created.
 * <p>
 * 
 * FIXME No one is watching the children of the logical service (the physical
 * services). The process that does that needs to trigger a comparison with the
 * service configuration znode for that logical service if one of the physical
 * service instances is killed.
 * 
 * FIXME If zookeeper dies (all instances) and is then brought back up there
 * will be a race condition where the physical services will (or should) try to
 * re-assert their ephemeral znodes and the {@link ServicesManagerServer} will
 * (or should) notice that there are no physical services for its logical
 * services.
 * <p>
 * Probably we need to notice the zookeeper reconnect and then have the
 * {@link ServicesManagerServer} wait a bit before taking any decisions,
 * effectively yeilding to the physical services so that they can re-establish
 * their ephemeral znodes.
 * <p>
 * This needs to be evaluated in practice. For example, is the natural behavior
 * of the {@link ZooKeeper} client to re-create any ephemeral znodes owned by it
 * which were in existence at the time of the disconnect?
 * 
 * FIXME I am not convinced that we want to take down the child processes when
 * this service exits. It might be much nicer to leave them online (that is the
 * current behavior).
 * <p>
 * IF we do take them down, then when this service starts up we need to restart
 * any services which are declared in zookeeper but joined in jini. We should do
 * direct service discovery and then re-start any services that we can not find
 * running. [We don't want to do this on an ongoing basis because it would cause
 * any service that was deliberately shutdown to be restarted as soon as we
 * discover that it is no longer discoverable.]
 * <p>
 * IF we don't take them down, then I am not sure if the parent process will
 * exit under various operating systems. We might need to start the processes
 * slightly differently for that to work.
 * 
 * @todo management semantics for deleting znodes are not yet defined. Probably
 *       a physical service should watch its logicalService's znode and compete
 *       to re-create that znode if it is deleted. Likewise, the physical
 *       service should ensure that its own znode is not removed (that can be
 *       done via ACLs as well).
 *       <p>
 *       In particular, deleting a znode SHOULD NOT cause the corresponding
 *       logical or physical service to be terminated. Use the
 *       {@link RemoteDestroyAdmin} API to terminate physical services.
 * 
 * @todo The federation can be destroyed using {@link JiniFederation#destroy()}.
 * 
 * @todo document dependencies for performance counter reporting and supported
 *       platforms. perhaps config options for which counters are collected and
 *       which are reported to the LBS.
 * 
 * @todo if we constrain ourselves to one instance per host then this can be the
 *       process that reports host specific statistics to the LBS.
