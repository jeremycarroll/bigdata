/**
 * Watcher supporting distributed synchronous lock pattern.
 * <p>
 * A lock is just a node with {@link CreateMode#EPHEMERAL_SEQUENTIAL} children
 * modeling a queue of processes obeying a contract on the conditions under
 * which a process may proceed. The process whose child is ordered first in the
 * queue holds the lock. To release the lock the process simply deletes its node
 * in the queue. Each process seeking a lock creates a new child that watches
 * the previous child in the ordered queue. When it receives a
 * {@link WatchedEvent} (NodeDeleted) for that child, it has reached the head of
 * the queue.
 * <p>
 * Any processes wishing to contend for the lock must ensure the creation of the
 * lock node. This is a {@link CreateMode#PERSISTENT} znode. The SEQUENTIAL flag
 * COULD be used if processes have another means to communicate the identity of
 * the lock node. Lacking such a mechanism, the lock node must have a zpath
 * which can be computed by any process seeking to contend for the lock. That is
 * normally accomplished by naming the lock node for a resource with a well
 * known identity.
 * <p>
 * This class only watches the previous child in the queue (if any). Zookeeper
 * does not permit you to delete the parent without deleting the children, so
 * you will always the queue purged of children before the lock node itself is
 * deleted. If the child deleted from the queue, the next child in the queue
 * will be granted the lock.
 * <p>
 * Destroying the lock node will not cause the lock to be persistently destroyed
 * if the conditions still exist under which processes will contend for that
 * lock as some process will simply re-create the lock node and the queue will
 * become re-populated over time.
 * <p>
 * While a queue may seem excessive for one time operations, it provides
 * failover if the process holding the lock dies.
