/**
 * A low-latency {@link IResourceLockService} with deadlock detection,
 * escalation from shared (read/write) to exclusive, and resource hierarchy
 * locking. This is used primarily to support distributed operations on
 * relations, such as create/destroy vs use and lock of the relation owner for
 * db create / destroy. However, the resource hierarchy is conceptual and locks
 * may be obtained that bear no relationship to actual indices or relations.
 * This can be convenient for coordinating distributed processes.
 * 
 * FIXME test suite for Journal, LDS, EDS, and JDS.
 * 
 * FIXME The current implementation uses the namespace as a token, not a
 * hierarchy.
 * <p>
 * The concept of the resource hierarchy described here can be realized by
 * storing lock "tokens" in a B+Tree with Unicode keys. Lock tokens have two
 * kinds: exclusive and shared. The token must contain an identifier for the
 * lock instance, which could be a {@link UUID}. A exclusive lock token would
 * containing only a single {@link UUID} while a shared lock token would contain
 * one for each process having a shared lock on the resource. A granted time
 * should also be associated with the lock instance stored in the BTree. In
 * addition, for a distributed system, we would like to know who owns the lock
 * (the host). This could also be handled simply as {@link IResourceLock}
 * objects.
 * <p>
 * Rather than storing N objects in the value under a key, we could also format
 * the B+Tree like a sparse row store (or use a sparse row store). The primary
 * key would then be [(schema)|namespace|UUID] : [lockToken]. Since the
 * {@link UUID} is moved out of the value, we only store the granted time and
 * host info in the value.
 * <p>
 * An unisolated key range scan corresponding to the resource hierarchy would be
 * required to detect conflicting locks and grant any compatible locks.
 * <p>
 * Shared locks are compatible and could be processed together, but there needs
 * to be a queue and locks can only be granted for a resource hierarchy in a
 * fair ordering for that queue. (The definition here is a bit iffy since a lock
 * request for "ab" and for "abc" would presumably be on different queues or
 * perhaps a single queue is scanned for all locks.)
 * <p>
 * When a lock is released, we can scan the set of compatible locks waiting in
 * the queue and then grant them in the same unisolated operation.
 * <p>
 * Note: Full transaction support will be 2PL, but a specialized case that
 * should not require deadlock detection since all locks will be declared by the
 * time we do the commit.
 * <p>
 * 
 * @todo use a lock refresh policy for lock leases (5 minute lease default). The
 *       application acquires and releases locks. on the client side, a lock
 *       counter is maintained and the lease for the lock is automatically
 *       renewed before the lease would expire if the counter is non-zero.
 *       <p>
 *       Add a method to force the release of the lock and its lease and use
 *       that to release all locks held by the client when (a) they become
 *       finalizable; and (b) when the {@link IBigdataFederation} is closed.
 *       Make the locks canonical so that any shared lock for the same resource
 *       is the same lock object and any exclusive lock for the same resource is
 *       the same lock object. (In particular, the relation cache maintained by
 *       the {@link DefaultResourceLocator} should not keep other processes from
 *       acquiring an exclusive resource lock if the application is done with
 *       its shared lock.) Perhaps locks older than N seconds need to be closed,
 *       where N might be equal to the 1.5 x of the lease renew period without
 *       an acquire().
 *       <p>
 *       Add the ability to invalidate all shared locks in order to obtain an
 *       exclusive lock, e.g., for emergency ops. Clients must be notified that
 *       their lock is no good (throw exception) the next time they try to renew
 *       their shared lock (including when acquire is a cache hit on a lock
 *       lease).
