/**
 * <p>
 * Abstract base class for configurable services discoverable using JINI.
 * </p>
 * The recommended way to start a server is using the {@link ServiceStarter}.
 * 
 * <pre>
 *          java -Djava.security.policy=policy.all -cp lib\jini-ext.jar;lib\start.jar com.sun.jini.start.ServiceStarter src/test/com/bigdata/service/TestServerStarter.config
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Other command line options MAY be recommended depending on the JVM and the
 * service that you are starting, e.g., <code>-server</code>.
 * <p>
 * The server MAY be started using a <code>main</code> routine:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public static void main(String[] args) {
 * 
 *     new MyServer(args).run();
 * 
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The service may be <em>terminated</em> by terminating the server process.
 * Termination implies that the server stops execution but that it MAY be
 * restarted. A {@link Runtime#addShutdownHook(Thread)} is installed by the
 * server so that you can also stop the server using ^C (Windows) and possibly
 * <code>kill</code> <i>pid</i> (Un*x). You can record the PID of the process
 * running the server when you start it under Un*x using a shell script. Note
 * that if you are starting multiple services at once with the
 * {@link ServiceStarter} then these methods (^C or kill <i>pid</i>) will take
 * down all servers running in the same VM.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Services are <em>destroyed</em> using {@link DestroyAdmin}, e.g., through
 * the Jini service browser. Note that all persistent data associated with that
 * service is also destroyed!
 * </p>
 * 
 * FIXME javadoc update on how to start services.
 * 
 * @see http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6380355, which
 *      describes a bug in the service browser that will display a
 *      "NullPointerException" dialog box if you destroy a service which
 *      implements {@link DestroyAdmin} but not {@link JoinAdmin}.
 * 
 * @see http://java.sun.com/products/jini/2.0/doc/api/com/sun/jini/start/ServiceStarter.html
 *      for documentation on how to use the ServiceStarter.
 * 
 * @todo put a lock on the serviceIdFile while the server is running.
 * 
 * @todo make the serviceId ASCII hex digits (that is not the jini standard
 *       practice)?
 * 
 * @todo document exit status codes and unify their use in this and derived
 *       classes.
 * 
 * @todo add {@link StatusType} and link its values to the running state of the
 *       service.
 * 
 * @todo add {@link ServiceType} with suitable pretty icons.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:thompsonbry@users.sourceforge.net">Bryan Thompson</a>
